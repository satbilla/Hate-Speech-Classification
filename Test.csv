 A friendly note 
Peter,

This is NoC. I am here to try and explain something that I think you've misunderstood. The claim that I was denying peoplehood to Jews is incorrect. Those edits you've noted were, in fact, fighting a particular ANTISEMITIC person. His edits were such that he claimed Lazar Kaganovich was responsible for the Ukrainian Holodomor BECAUSE he was Jewish (and he tried to use Jewwatch as a source), tried to remove Israel from a list of countries selling pringles based on the incorrect assumption that Israel is not a country, and then went around inserting """"is a person of Jewish descent"""" into articles about Jews he did not like. I was not denying Jews peoplehood, I was corecting the fallacy that Judaism is only a genetic ethnicity, which is a lie perpetrated by people like Hitler. Sposer explained it to you exactly as I would have. There are many many Jews who are not decendents of the original Hebrews. There are people who converted, people who were the product of mixed marriages in Europe, etc. They are Jews too. Concentrating on the religion aspect does not deny peoplehood, rather it eliminates the fallacy that Jews are a """"race"""" only. If you would like to discuss further, please ask Fayssal for my e-mail and I will be happy to talk to you. I am doing my best to at least clear up these misconceptions. Best wishes. 75.3.113.9  """

I'm not the """"paid editor"""" to which you referred, but I am gravely concerned by the proposal for a change to the terms of use that describes edits as """"deception"""" and allows anyone to make such accusations against any editor at any time. It is impossible for editors to prove they are *not* receiving some form of benefit. The examples of """"benefit"""" (which the WMF has tried to obfuscate now that some people have noticed the expansiveness of the proposal) includes things like receiving a t-shirt or a meal (any """"money, goods or services""""). Unfortunately, there's a great deal of handwaving about paid editing, but very little evidence that there's any greater bias in edits that are paid for than edits that are not.  A large number of the articles created in the latest paid editing """"scandal"""" are still present, and many that were deleted still easily met our notability standards. There is not a good faith editor who hasn't received some sort of benefit or reward from their work on Wikipedia. Nobody has yet demonstrated that people who are paid do any worse at editing Wikipedia than people who aren't paid.  Meanwhile, there's lots of evidence that people who want to push a point of view will not hesitate to accuse editors of being paid or otherwise having a serious conflict of interest (q.v., the Arbcom archives). The proposal is one more tool in the arsenal for people who are motivated to go after their opponents, and does absolutely nothing at all to improve the project.    """

Support for unblock request
See Shell's response to this block, made directly to Gnan/garra: via  Diffs..
Users like me are not permitted to edit archives of project pages like AN/I.  The request asked me to do something that it would have been a violation of Wikipedia editing policy/guidelines for me to do.
Please follow the """"previous"""" and """"next"""" edits in the above link to """"Diffs."""" just provided. The block, even the reason given for it, just illustrates (in my view) additional piling on of already-unwarranted accusations.
Shell points out the unfair nature of this block: see """"Diffs."""" linked above (move through to """"previous"""" and """"next""""; all of the material has been deleted from Gnan/garra's current talk page.
Why is the administrator not following the same requirements re: """"archiving"""" of current discussions that s/he thinks was required of me by User:John Carter (though JC says it was not).  There was no """"condition"""" or """"requirement"""" in the closing administrator (JC)'s closing summary/conclusion.  I voluntarily added the archiving bot (which is or was malfunctioning apparently, as I have alerted both Shell and Gnan/garra.
My reasonable and logical presentation of my own perspective on the AN/I was posted before not after the """"request"""" by Gnan/garrait had  in it and was edited out in the past day but I put it back in so Shell and Gnan/garra could refer to it more easily.
Labeling my comments as a """"rant"""" or a """"screed"""" is likewise still unwarranted and even (in my view) a violation of Wikipedia:Etiquette, as I have said in the Sept. 5 now-archived AN/I.
Shell has already indicated that this block should be removed (unblocked) and why she thinks so.
My list of comments above was posted prior to Gnan/Garra's archive 25 post (which is misplaced and which I myself restored in #request above; see the date/time stamps.
I did not make (and do not make) any personal attacks (""""PA"""") against anyone and I have not """"reiterated"""" any such """"PA""""; the word """"inhumane"""" is not my word; that is Gnan/garra's word (paraphrase), after quoting me from a now-archived AN/I also out of context.
Again: please provide """"diffs.""""  Paraphrasing and using words like """"inhumane"""" which I myself did not use does not substantiate any claim of my engaging in any such """"PA"""" (personal attack).  I did not engage in any such thing.
I did not """"accuse"""" anyone of anything and certainly did not use uncivil or offensive language, though others did so in that AN/I (see the editing summary, which contains improper expletive language by another user); I said that a user repeatedly seems to lack humane compassion and linked to (earlier version of) my current """"N.B."""" (scroll up); I observed that earlier in the July 2008 AN/I, and still feel that way.  I am being attacked, while I have not attacked anyone (the policy is WP:NPA.  There was no claim of """"personal attacks"""" leveled at me in what Orderinchaos filed on September 5, 2008; all his/her claims have been proved to be incorrect and false.
I have engaged in no blockable """"behavior"""" from July 15 until now; and I still question the block initiated in July; nevertheless, I accepted the terms of that block and immediately accepted an offer of adoption.
I was not the one who """"canceled"""" the adoption by Ecoleetage.  The adopter (Ecoleetage) canceled it on his own after seeing what he says he considered no reason to continue it.
I thought he had or would have contacted User:John Carter to inform him of that, but, apparently, he did not.  That was Ecoleetage's action, not mine.
There was no """"collusion"""" with Ecoleetage on either my part or his part, as Orderinchaos mistakenly claims there was (in the Sept. 5 AN/I statements at top of it).(See I wonder above, Shell's response, and my reply to that.
I have not stated that Orderinchaos engaged in anything but possibly-inadvertent misstatements; nonetheless, they are misstatements and false accusations, which led to further misstatements about my alleged """"behavior"""" from July 15 to September 5, 2008.  Any reply I made was later maligned as if it were a """"rant"""" or a """"screed"""" and not accorded the respect that it deserved and deserves as a good-faith"

However, Carey is a phenomenal singer regardless of her full range. Hell, I have a range of over three octaves, but I'm only effective in slightly under two, i.e. I can really only sing in my effective range. I can *reach* the outer limits of the larger range but I can't sustain pitch accuracy or handle any considerable length of melody. Again, regardless of her range, she's proved many times over that she is effective in most of her range. Vision Of Love remains one of the most remarkable vocal performances I've ever heard. I'd love to hear her sing some of Hildegard von Bingen's music, she's probably the only popular singer who could actually do it with ease. Btw, Billie Holiday was one of the greatest singers yet her full range not broad - some say only about an octave and a half - and she packs more meaning and soul into her renditions than most better-endowed voices. Range is no determinate of anything but boundary conditions, the real news is what gets done within the given range, of course. Again, I think MC is simply phenomenal in that regard.

BTW, the gripe here is that you did a near total reversion of everything I added, on the grounds that you felt the entire edit was POV biased, without even paying attention to what I added.  And at the start of this thread, I noted that AGI in particular was removed from this article and felt it was very reasonable to add that fact back in.  As for the """"Program Costs"""" subsection that I added, yes, it needed quite a bit more work.  But it is a legitimate criticism that has been raised in other forums and not just by myself.  If you had removed that one section alone, I wouldn't be so upset about what else has transpired.  I'm glad that you've """"added back"""" some of the content I put in, but I still am not completely pleased with the tone of the article and still feel a POV bias at the moment.  I will express further objections seperately.   

 Breaking up article 

I would like to propose that all of the information about People to People International specifically be moved to a completely seperate and independent article.  Clearly PPI is more than just the Student Ambassador Program, and as this article is written there seems to be a blending and melding of the two ideas and concepts.  This article ought to be about the program itself (clearly the """"flagship"""" program of PPI).  By doing this, I think it will help this article out as well by removing the contentious issue, the relationship between PPI and AGI, and allow this article to get on with the issue of simply describing the program and who is involved.  Information such as the awards that PPI have recieved are irrelevant to describing this program, as is invoking the name of Mother Teresa in a fallacious honor by association.   

 Listing of countries visited by P2PSA groups

__TOC__

 New archive 
This page has been quiet for a few weeks, so I created a new archive at Talk:Monty Hall problem/Archive 9 for the discussions from mid Oct 2008 through Feb 2009 (indicated as """"archived"""" above).  Several of the issues aren't exactly resolved (they will perhaps never be resolved to everyone's satisfaction), but the period of relative calm seemed like an opportune time to create a new archive.  I added a new section (post archiving) much like this one.  user:Glkanter has reverted these changes, suggesting we talk about it first.  OK.  Since we're at a lull in the discussion here, and the talk page is huge, I suggest now is an appropriate time to archive.   Rick Block (talk) 

 Agree with archiving now. The talk page is monster-sized, and nobody is going to read through it all anyway. –  

I don't agree there has been a 'lull'. It's just been re-directed to the arguments page. I assume most readers (not necessarily editors) do NOT read archives. If they're interested, maybe they get as far as a talk page. Anyway, I think that the existence and vehement nature of the MHP article disagreement would not be evident if the entire thing were archived. A reader might think that there was universal satisfaction with the construction of the article. That would be an inaccurate impression to give.   

This thread will remain here, and it already says there are unresolved issues.  If you'd like to enumerate them here that will remain here as well.  Good enough?  Rick Block (talk) 

I didn't know there was an """"arguments"""" page, so I too thought it had settled down.  It would be very useful to have a concise list here of what the ongoing issues about the article are, phrased as neutrally as possible, with links to where some discussion about them may be found.

2980,"Lion vs Tiger: Consenses Request 

Hello Keith, I was wondering if you could help fix the lion vs tiger topic, it seems the topic has a certain someone with abusuing wikipedias ethics and using it to pump out some type of bias supremacy, cherry picking and being subjective, even contradicting his own guidelines he uses, makes false accusations and is hypocritical to his own suggestions.

I'd like to start it off with suggesting to review the revision of its current and compare it to a previous one:
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tiger_versus_lion&diff;=prev&oldid;=591817160

Changes were made simply because some of the data was unreliable as stated in the talk:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tiger_versus_lion

I have learned that I must only make comments on the edits, and not the editors, so I will try and keep it as so to better adress it. My main delima is, this topic has been unchecked for years, and has no true consensus that is confirmed reliable and un-bias, so I would like to request if you could share the info with a few others to develop a basic un-bias assesment, I'd like to start it off with pointing out a guide line:

Under its:

History

The qualifications: Should be of historical signifcance, so only people with back grounds of Ph.d and Masters degrees should be accepted for reliability and credability via Historians.

Physical comparison

The qualifications: Should be adressed on a species scale, the historical significance is graded on its history, so it must refraim from cherry picking sub-speices via bengal and siberian, but then leave out the malay, sumatran, bali ect and include all of them to reach an average.

Accidental fights in captivity

The qualifications: All historical/modern accounts should be fully brought to the awareness of the world/public, the details should be mentioned for both sides regardless if its a un-fair fight of gender, age, and quanity/odds, all documentation should be accepted according to reliablility, as of now there is only pro-tiger data that is in effect as pure insinuation, via cherry picked while other reliable sources that supports the lion is being constantly erased with no viable reasons other than false accusations and making things up.

Expert opinions

The qualifications: Should be upon people with observation upon seeing them fight, an opinion from someone with experince working with these animals is not enough and holds no merits since the topic is specifically on fighting, if they haven't seen them fight (has no cites mentioning a observed fight) it shoulden't be used, only people who have been eye witnesses to conflicts between the two should be used for credability.

I am suggesting a more fair assesment since what is in place now is subjective, bias and pro-data, both sides of the coin should be mentioned, all the substance should be mentioned both ways, and a fair assesment on what is avaliable to add in should be implimented both ways of its reliability and credability.

Thank you for your time"
12999,"Records of Awesome Editors Who Truly Want To Help==

As this is not a study of people's hesitancy, it is not a suitable source for claims about the reasons for people's hesitancy. It would appear to be at best a study making claims about vaccines themselves, not a study about hesitancy or about controversy. If this study is the reason for people's hesitancy, then we should be pointing to a reliable third-party source that states that it's the reason, not to the study itself. If we say people stopped going to the beach because of the film Jaws, we use as a reference the source that makes that statement, not the film itself. So no, it's not a reliable source for what you claim you want to use it for. Nat Gertler (talk) 

That has got to be the clearest explanation yet. So what you are saying is cite a source that says there is controversy over the vaccine schedule because there is a correlation with infant mortality, then cite both sources? Or should I use opinion pieces like most of the other references in the article? Even the journal of medicine piece is an opinion piece. Is this where wiki gets the facts, from opinions, then excludes peer reviewed journal articles because it is WP:OR? It is built by popular opinion of the editors, from opinion pieces, not allowing facts...if this is indeed true....though I hope notDcrsmama (talk) 
No, I'm not saying cite both sources. References are there to verify the facts that are being stated in Wikipedia's voice. If the statement being sourced is that there is a controversy due to correlation with infant mortality, then we cite a source that is discussing the controversy - there is no need to cite the study. Even if the source says that there is a controversy because of this particular study, we might mention this study in the text, but the study itself is not reference for the statement. And I am addressing the specific request for input that you made in your initial posting. If you have concerns about the other sources in the article, you may wish to raise them in a specific post about the specific concerns. Nat Gertler (talk)

It's not really an abbreviation in the sense you mean; it's two words combined to make a new name. In that sense, it just becomes a proper noun. The thing with """"forex"""" is that it actually refers to """"foreign exchange"""", and is thus an abbreviation, whereas """"Pasmo"""" is simply the name of something (and the etymology is not crucial to its function as such).

And even if you insist that it's an abbreviation, there's still no reason for it to appear in all-caps. The forex page on Wikipedia doesn't even use all-caps for """"forex,"""" so that kind of dumps your argument (not to be rude, but this is the case: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forex).

Also note that EBay, when refering to itself (on its website and in reports, etc.), starts sentences with """"eBay,"""" but the Wall Street Journal quite rightly follows convention and begins such sentences with """"EBay.""""

I find the trend of using all-caps when there is no basis for doing so highly annoying. It also, quite simply, goes against well-established rules of style. *Regardless* of what style the company forces its English translators and copywriters to follow (probably against their will) for the corporate website and materials, Wikipedia is free to follow normal English conventions. Wikipedia does not have to support the company's misguided use of SHOUTING (which is (and this is an unverifiable statement based on experience) probably due to a lack of understanding of English style conventions—or a refusal to accept them, even after they have been explained—rather than due to an informed decision based on whether the name constitutes an acronym/abbreviation or not).

As an American historian I see that there is strong support for gun ownership rights and has there been for centuries. Many Americans see this as a valid argument against gun control and in America it is not a fringe theory. The article is about Gun Control and one could infer American Gun control because it is no longer an issue in most other countries. The argument has legs and to deny that is to deny history for political motivations. Whether or not we agree with the argument is irrelevant. History is not about voting on current policies. The proper thing to due is to have arguments for and against the viewpoint and not to bury it because like a zombie it will rise again.

History of Primal Therapy article

I read through the recent discussions on Talk:Primal_therapy. I also added two more comments to the Talk:Arthur_Janov page. Did you send an email enquiry? The 1973 date for France D's marriage to Art is without credibility. After the divorce, to Vivian's great credit, she avoided the temptation to publicly humiliate Arthur Janov. After all, he wrote in the original Primal Scream: """"It is instructive to note that married couples who have both gone through Primal Therapy have never separated."""" (chapter 12). And according to France D. Janov's own admission in the Primal Center's Video Series 2, she enrolled at the Primal Institute because excessive marihuana use had broken down her gates. So it's a fact that Art married a former patient.

My feeling is that despite being tagged as a stub, the content of the Arthur Janov article is just about right for an encyclopedia entry. It isn't really the place to dissect Janov's reputation. I know it happens in other Wikipedia biographies, but in many cases it has got out of hand. I agree with your suggestion on the Primal therapy Talk page that this kind of material belongs in a separate History of Primal Therapy article. The Conocer piece doesn't strike me as a sound source of verifiable information, so I put together some links to articles which can be found online:

If you type Emotional Intelligence into Google the No.1 result is Steve Hein's eqi.org website. He interviewed a former patient who attended Arthur Janov's Primal Center in the late 1990's. You can find his interview notes here, labelled """"cautionary note"""".

Janov's bio on the Primal Center website states: """"The latest research conducted at Dr. Janov’s Primal Center on the effects of Primal Therapy on the brain was performed by Dr. Erik Hoffman, former Professor of Neurophysiology at Copenhagen University."""" You can read  what Erik Hoffmann, Ph.D., is doing now at Hoffmann's website.

On this page you can find a transcript of Dr. E. Michael Holden's account of what happened to him after he left the Primal Institute.

Carol Mither's book, Therapy Gone Mad, identifies case histories from Janov's first two books that were written by defendants in the lawsuits against The Center for Feeling Therapy.  Simon ( )

Thanks, Simon - Why can't you create an account like normal Wikipedians complete with a talk page? I don't think the History idea will come to much, There is just insufficient well sourced information to make much out of it - especially in view of Cgingold's latest analyses on the Primal Therapy talk page regarding derogatory statements about living individuals. I have already read the Michael Holden swan song twice - sad case.  

You seem to be applying two standards of evidence. The Primal Therapy article gives an outline of primal theory based on Arthur Janov's books alone, which were written to attract paying customers to his exclusive and expensive private treatment center. Last September, I wrote in the Primal Therapy talk page: Will the article have something to offer readers who want to know about Stettbacher's method, or the International Primal Association, or the plethora of copycat primal centers that flourished in the 1970s? There is sufficient well sourced information available for a history article  for a start, two books about The Center for Feeling Therapy, Erik Hoffmann's bio, and the transcript of Dr. E. Michael Holden's audio tape which was played a number of times at the IPA convention in 1983. The books by Carol Mithers and Tomas Videgård are already referenced in the main article. I have a copy of Videgård's book, by the way. Also, Professor Steven Rose wrote a one-page account of his research with Arthur Janov in Lifelines:
""""As Janov had hoped, it turned out that before therapy, the quantity of these particular receptors in his client's platelets was considerably below normal. Within six months of therapy, clients' depression had lifted, and the biochemical and immunological measures I was making approached the average for 'normal' non-depressed people of the same age and sex.""""
Further down the same page he added:
""""I obtained similar biochemical results when, a couple of years later, I did a similar study with depressed clients going through other, less dramatic forms of psychotherapy, so I suspect that in such cases the therapist matters more than the therapeutic theory.""""

I couldn't find a source for Image:Gene Baur 2.jpg and Image:Gene Baur 1.jpg so you can see the """"Better Source Request"""" tag I put on there and notified the use to provide a better source for the images. The main confusion is that if you look at this image page and it will state """" Please feel free to use this image with credit to Farm Sanctuary"""". But if you click on the """"Click Here"""" for a high resolution TIF, they state not to use for commercial uses, which would be incompatible with our policy. Also confusing in the matter, the user has a username that implies they are a part of this organization, along with their userpage that states as such. The image on their userpage was uploaded by someone else though, who is interested in the same topics and has few edits anyways. I would say they are the same person. Lastly, the image on their userpage (:Image:FarmSanctuary.JPG) has a unique message I've never seen before about OTRS that says they gave permission. I asked on IRC and the OTRS folks said it was only for that image, but it seems they would be likely willing to license the others, if asked. My guess: Email the folks at the foundation, and ask them to do what they did for the other image, for the other 6 images that this user uploaded. You could list them under """"Possible Unfree Image-disputed"""" (it's a bad name) using {{PUIdisputed}} and follow the directions on the tag, though I doubt it would get as much attention as I have given it, but this is the """"standard"""" method of dealing with these things, I think. ≈talk """

I have edited the statement regarding the association between neutering and osteosarcoma (OSA) because it was far stronger than the citation, or the literature in general, supports. In a single study of a single breed with a known risk for osteosarcoma far higher than most other breeds, the data showed the total lifetime exposure to sex hormones was negatively correlated with the incidence of OSA. The incidence of the disease was not statistically different between neutered and intact animals overall, though it was different between animals neutered at less than 1 year of age and intact animals. And there is no reason to suggest these findings would support a general relationship between neutering and OSA incidence in other breeds or mixed-breed dogs. Given the questionable clinical significance of the finding (intact animals actually died slightly, though not significantly, earlier than neutered animals overall) and the much more thoroughly demonstrated protective benefits of neutering on life expectancy and other kinds of cancer, I do not find this study sufficient to support a general assertion that OSA risk is a meaningful disadvantage of neutering.

I'm not sure the OED is particularly helpful here, as it is very slow-moving, and often imprecise, being more concerned (from what I can tell) with describing casual usage than precision usage (and yes, I do have it; micro-print edition; I'd love to have the full-size version, but I don't have that kind of money laying around.

 Caught in the merge crossfire 

Thanks
Just to say thank you for your help dealing with my opposition to the merger proposal for Bispham High School Arts College which linked into the Portsmouth and Southampton merger proposals simply because the proposer (who appears to have been using these merger proposals to make a point rather than discussing them anywhere) chose the school seemingly at random after they saw it mentioned on the Wikipedia Schools project talk page. Not being sure what to do about this, your help in supporting my opposition to the merger and removal of the tag has been really useful, and much appreciated. ·Talk 

You are welcome; it is a shame that Bispham High School Arts College got caught in the crossfire.  I know how difficult it is to put together an acceptably cited entry for a school, especially one with a short history, having spent the best part of a day on Admiral Lord Nelson School (Portsmouth) back when the Portsmouth nonsense first started.  

I must say the infobox and logo make the page look very professional, I must do the same later in the week.

You might find these links useful, assuming I have the right school.

15064,"""

I've got to say, I've read you """"pacafistic"""" rules, seen your idea of """"logic"""", and have heard tales of your """"justification"""" and I just have to say:

I have this to say on my behavior:
I'm a perfectly reasonable person when it comes to arguements, even when they are against my favor. I change subjects, help the people with simple little details they might have gotten wrong, ask them for proper information that I might use against them, basically anything a scatter brainer would do.

I let people have their ways for a little while just to experiment with how it turns out, I try to help BOTH OF US come out on top, I treat both equelly, and I don't get angry when someone yells in my face.

Why should I? They are angry first so I know they are suffering enough and would only poke at them some more just to annoy them (sound fimiliar?) I give them their space though I would still do what I did/do to annoy them. Except, I do it without coming into contact with them (as they would do to me) which I know we'd both appreciate.

I keep the sitch isolated someone else doesn'tblow the entire thing out of proportion before me and that person can resolve the matter only with each other which is inevitable. Others can't resolve the problem, only make it bigger and more serious for either 1 or both. see below.

If they ever try to apologize I tell them not to→ because I wouldn't→ because I have no reason to→ because we shouldn't have been in a scrabble no if ands or buts about it. Conflict is stupid. Almost (but not quite) as stupid as the species that create/embrace it. Leave the creatures space to realize this and you will have peace once more until the next pointless bicker and inevitable resolve.

Now, I have this to say about the """"good"""" people of wikipedia:
Wow.
There sure aren't a lot of you. I wonder why... You've seen many cases and classes of human behavior and traits, you (think) you know what to expect. Well you have most of it down. But you went wrong at a few turns:
1. You (blindly) follow invalid rules and principles that completely misinterpret the act and are constantly showing how much shit they're full of.

2. You think you got """"human psychology"""" in the bag and have tried to play from this to class your principles into rules but your system is far outdated and very inhumane.

3. You don't want to and try not to link yourselves and articles with POV(point of views) but little have you realized your entire system thrives apon it. 
You take sides in arguments between users based solely on what YOU think is most right based apon how YOU have been taught what is right. You are NO ONE to interpret what """"mad"""", """"kind"""", """"eccentric"""", ect. is. Just another group of the bunch and they all think seperately on subjects or else we'd look and be exactly the same. And you don't want that. 
And don't you tell me to calm down, I get just the opposite when people try to make me look crazy that way, and it certainly isn't any diffen't with Bots. 

4. Most importantly, you robots are full of shit:
You take leaders/favorites→ who take favorites→ who put up with your shit like its the right thing to do because they don't knowwhat else to do. Sickening.

2a. You abuse your power instead of embracing it's enlightenment.
Don't you get it?! He wasn't going to block me himself because he wanted to toy with me. He knew I knew he was higher than me and could just as easily waved a hand and blocked me himself. But he didn't. He wanted to add insult to injury. 
You think people want to have someone powerful to look up to? NO! They want to be someone powerful so they can feel embraced/in. 
We all want what we shouldn't have. 
Unfortunately, there are some of us who already have what we shouldn't have.

5. How you go about it is the wrong way. 
Some things people must learn for themselves. You have a problem, try relying on yourself and no one else to resolve.  
If some people are fighting with each other over the internet just sit back and let them/butt out and leave them to their bickering. Sooner or later they will stop arguing of their own account/or reasoning. Or they may even just """"stop"""". BUT if someone bigger than both of them butts in and takes a side however they see fit, things will get much worse.

I'll let you know whether you care or not...:

 Here's something for you to report  you have more poop in your pants. Vandals are people who disrupt wikipedia, like people who get bent out of shape over comments made on talk pages for IP address, rather than focusing on something...  Important. They write condescending comments and put images of exclamation points in them and avoid communicating with other people like they're people, instead they use an impersonal language of template-style warnings sent like notices from bill collectors (who would, hypothetically also have poopie pants). You may feel like you're being very noble by reporting this kind of comments to AIV, and that when someone communicates with you in a way that you're not familiarly with or that makes you uncomfortable that it's """"vandalism"""" and """"personal attacks.""""

The only possibility to join the Schengen zone would be to enter into a treaty with the EU, which includes a clause that Schengen-related EU law would be applicable in the associated non-EU state. The associated state would only have the right to be consulted. Thus, the U.S. would have to accept each and every majority (!) decision taken in Brussels whether citizens of this or that country would need a visa for entry into the area or not. And the U.S. would have to accept that every third-country national holding a residence title of a Schengen state could enter the U.S. without even being checked. To BIL: Guadeloupe and French Guiana are not inside the Schengen area because this would e.g. require France to equip the complete rain forest border between French Guiana and Suriname, Brasil etc. with high-tech infrared sensors which would detect every monkey which is crossing the border - just in order to avoid ID checks on flights between there and Europe.

The name is, to be blunt, nonsensical. No actual 10-string guitarist or authority on this instrument uses this terminology, which is entirely 's own creation. Why the anachronistic """"classical""""? Neither the 10-stringed harp-guitar of the 19th century nor the modern 10-string guitar is an instrument from the Classical period, and an acoustic guitar is as little limited to the performance of so-called """"Classical"""" music as an acoustic piano is. And what exactly is meant by """"extended-range""""? Extended from what? This is assuming that the guitar had a fixed range, which is a fallacy considering most of the notable guitarists of the 19th century (Sor, Carulli, Coste, Mertz, Legnani, Manjon, etc.) also wrote for/performed on guitars with more than 6 strings, many of which had a treble range that was extended beyond the 19th/20th fret that is the norm on today's guitars. All in all this is a nonsensical title for an article that should simply be called """"ten-string guitar"""" that that should include only historically significant instruments (i.e. not things like the Marlow 10-string guitar). And there should be a separate article for the """"Yepes 10-string guitar"""", which this article currently simply continues to confuse with unrelated developements that have nothing to do with the primary defining characteristic of the Yepes instrument: its singualr tuning which uniquely gives sympathetic string resonance in unison with any note fretted on the treble strings.

19142,"Let's take the U.S. Internal Revenue Service as an example. I'm going to use somewhat non-technical terms.

This is very simplified but, generally speaking, the auditor examines the taxpayer's records (or other records) to determine the correct amounts of income, deductions, tax, etc. The auditor generally is not involved in trying to obtain the actual tax payment. At the IRS, the top people who work as auditors (or examiners) are called Revenue Agents.

The tax collector comes into the picture much later  after the amount of the tax has been determined. The collector isn't trying to determine the correct amount of tax; the collector is trying to obtain payment of the tax, or to seize assets to sell to satisfy the tax that the IRS claims is owed. At the IRS, the top people who work as tax collectors are called Revenue Officers.

If you compare Revenue Agents and Revenue Officers, a Revenue Agent (auditor) is likely to know more than a Revenue Officer (collector) knows about substantive federal tax law: what items are income, what items are not income, what expenses or other items are deductible, what items are not deductible, what credits are allowed, how the tax is properly computed, etc.

The Revenue Officer is likely to know more than a Revenue Agent knows about procedural federal tax law: how a federal tax lien arises; what things the IRS has to do to perfect the tax lien as against the taxpayer's other creditors, what rights the taxpayer to a hearing prior to seizure of assets, how to legally seize assets, what kinds of assets may be legally seized without a court order, what kinds of seizures require a court order, and so on."

13491,"Question about guardian angels
According to the wiki article on demonology, there are 133,306,668 demons and the bible says
1/3 of the angels fell from heaven and became demons.  Therefore, this would mean that there
are 266,613,336 good angels (i.e. 133,306,668 + 266,613,336 = 399,920,004 total good and bad
angels with the bad angels being 1/3 of 399,920,004)

Given that there are about 6 billion people on the earth currently, this would mean that
a guardian angel would have to have more than one person he/she/it is responsible for.
I assume that God would not assign someone a demon to be his/her guardian angel, so this
makes the number of possible guardian angels at maximum, 266,613,336.  Since the world
population is now 6,542,502,827 this would mean that each guardian angel would have to
be assigned 24 to 25 people.

Does the above really sound reasonable to you guys?

Also, what did those 266 million guardian angels do when there was less than 266 million
people on the earth? (The world population reached 266 million around the year 1000 or so)"

24830,"Wow! this is disruptive, you are 100% mistaken and hella-wrong and I'm certain it is not the first time. If I'm not mistaken, It sounds like you are telling me to piss off and go edit somewhere else. I certainly do not want to sound uncivil but don't be a Bully or a dick.

I have not used or added or any sources to the main entry that were not already there or that you did not restore yourself! If you say a source I used on this entry affects my credibility then you show be. Which source specifically are you referring to?

It would take a real simpleton to believe the current conspiracy but you'd be much worse off mentally if you still believed that our government plus Canada, UK, and Australia hasn't ever worked together on a series of covert projects designed to spread biological agents over a large scale (across continents) from airplanes. I hope that's not the case here.  Go ahead and call that what I just described a conspiracy. I dare you- in fact I double-dog-dare you! It is declassified and admitted and on a participating government website. I'll assume good faith, perhaps it is ignorance of the subject on your parts. It ok, I'm ignorant of a lot of wikipedia editing stuff. Belief in documented past history is the not the same as a belief in some conspiracy theory crap. Based on you comments about me, this is a concept you appear to be having trouble with. Any competent person would understand they are not the same. Is there was one available to you to explain it? I was explained to you repeatedly on this page and on my talk page. You are pretty dense of you don't have it yet.  You will find that my primary sources are 100 times more accurate than anything you'll ever find on about this fringe topic.  I am a subject matter expert on certain aspects of CBW and exposures but not on chem trails but no about to out myself to convince you.  Government declassified primary sources on WP are to be used sparingly. People like you make it difficult to talk about serious subjects. Reasonable people should not be constrained in their edits by pure ignorance unless ignorance is the consensus (TBD).  You are unable to consider ever it which speaks to your credibility.

6180,"Request to Unblock
I began writing the following statement (excepting its two postscripts) before I was blocked. I suspect that User: AuburnPilot had me blocked, in order to prevent me from complaining to administrators about his misconduct. Although I was directed to request an unblock of User: Physicq210, who had blocked me, requesting such of the latter would require that I censor myself, and write as though User: Physicq210 had acted in good faith, and was one of the good guys. That would be surreal, and would give User: Physicq210 a moral legitimacy belied by his actions. And so, the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator BUT User: Physicq210, but since I’m not a devious sort, I have nothing against the latter reading this. Indeed, I want User: Physicq210 to read it. For if I can be banned from Wikipedia for standing up to censors, then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting, than to go down the long dark road of self-abnegation and self-censorship, including the use of bad English. After all, if I wanted to be a lackey, I could go to graduate school.

WIKI Administrators’ Notice Board Incidents
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents

User: AuburnPilot

A few days ago, User: AuburnPilot began stalking me, checking wherever I had made edits, and going to the articles in question and vandalizing them. He or she has been manipulating Wikipedia rules as cover for what is clearly political censorship. User: AuburnPilot cannot even stand for Wikipedia readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes. Zero tolerance!

He claims of any source he politically dislikes, that it is either “spam” or a “blog” (or “POV,” another favorite dodge for those at Wikipedia seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own POV), even though the one source is a previously published, classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the Web (http://geocities.com/nstix/waronpolice.html), which the author has seen fit to publish on his Web site, and the other source is the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the Duke rape hoax (http://vdare.com/stix/070113_duke.htm).

Note that I am not even talking about censoring writing within articles, since I hadn’t done any writing on the articles in question: Crystal Gail Mangum, Michael Nifong, 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal and Racial profiling.
I’ve been involved in edit wars before, though I have never been the aggressor, and have never initiated an elective edit war, though given the self-assurance that aggressors such as User: AuburnPilot exude, perhaps I ought to reconsider that position. It seems that aggressors rule here.

The reason I am making a formal complaint is that User: AuburnPilot has tonight upped the ante, threatening to have me banned
(http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.23.199.239&redirect;=no), if I do not surrender to his censorship. Should you find for me, please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a cease-and-desist order. Should you, however, find for the censor, please provide an Index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors.

P.S. January 19, 2007 115A EST. Since beginning this complaint, I see that User: AuburnPilot has in fact succeeded at getting a crony, User: Physicq210, to block me, thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me, but preventing me from responding to his thuggery. (And no, I am not going to use cutesy, euphemistic language. If I were into such deception, I would have become a liar, er, lawyer, and would be worthless as an encyclopedist.) And I was unable to e-mail User: Physicq210 because I am not logged in and “You must be logged in and have a valid authenticated e-mail address in your preferences to send e-mail to other users.” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Physicq210)

If this isn’t cyber-Stalinism, I don’t know what is! So, let me get this straight. Stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces (User: AuburnPilot’s penchant for saying “Thank you” after vandalizing one’s links) is “civil,” but complaining about such abuse counts as “spam, disruption, incivility, and personal attacks.” If that is verily so, then 2 + 2 = 5.

P.P.S The message here says that I was “temporarily blocked from editing Wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits.” What the heck is that supposed to mean? For restoring footnotes and links that User: AuburnPilot had vandalized? If that constitutes “disruptive edits,” then you’ve utterly given up on honest English and all human decency. Sorry, but I don’t have any sympathy for the Devil."

 Argument Without End citations are historical transposition? 

There's something in the """"Diem Era"""" section stating that McNamara wrote X about motivations in Argument Without End.  I would be leery of ascribing this as a contemporary statement in the 1950s (which is what the phrase indicates), because McNamara wrote the book in 1999, one of several he wrote on Vietnam long after the fact.

14397,"- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.

It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. 

Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.

For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.

It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.

And too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.

As you are ignorant of even the most rudimentary conventions of honorable duelling it is my duty to inform you that it is the challenger, not the challenged who determines distance, as stated in rule #16 of the Codo Duello. You must also elaborate on the pistols to be used, otherwise I will assume any caliber semi-automatic is permissable. As you have chosen the grounds, you are also responsible for providing the boat on which the pistol duel will take place. If you are unable to find a boat with a large enough deck to accomodate an honorable duel (at least twenty paces of unobstructed space in a corridor ten feet wide) another option is that two smaller boats may be used, in calm seas. Inflatable rafts and non-motorized dingheys are not acceptable. I must commend you on selecting a cowardly weapon which greatly complicates the relatively straightforward process of an at-seas duel, you perfidious poltroon. Should you miraculously acquire vertabrae between now and the chosen date, I will gladly agree to a change in weapons, especially to epees. The time is acceptable to me. Please note that duels cannot take place within the jurisdiction of Canada, and therefore must take place at least 200 nautical miles (not standard miles) from the continental margin, to avoid breaking laws which expressly forbid dueling. 

I await the duel eagerly. Please offer my advance condolences to your family members.

That's what WP:V would have us do.  

As for the clean install part, well, Vista only supported direct upgrades from XP, not 2000, so it's not out of the realm of possibility that they'll only support direct-upgrading from Vista.  The Register contacted Microsoft on the topic of XP -> 7 upgrades, and they responded with ''“I can confirm that customers will be able to purchase upgrade media and an upgrade license to move from Windows XP to Windows 7 - however, they will need to do a clean installation of Windows 7, ..... This requires the user to back up their data, install Windows 7, re-install the programs and restore their data. For PCs running Windows Vista customers have the option of an in-place upgrade of Windows 7 keeping their data and programs intact or to perform a clean install of Windows 7.”  So.... that's that.

 Is OhInternet a recreation of Encyclopedia Dramatica? 

To tangent from the above topics…

Oh Internet is not Encyopedia Dramatica as the article supposes. 'Encyclopedia Dramatica' is defined as the domain name 'www.encyclopediadramatica.com' and the intellectual property concerned with ED copyright. OhInternet, however is a different project entirely; notable differences: a new XML coding system, logo and form of satire. To use terms in the article: the site was not 'overhauled' but rather 'replaced'. 

To use Silverseren's analogy, if Wikipedia did rename itself, kept most of its higher administration and stopped using Wikimedia software would it still be Wikipedia? The answer is """"No"""". The Wikipedia name and intellectual property becomes inactive, lost. If one were to charge a Wikipedia fork site with copyright violations they would have to give evidence of their ownership of Wikipedia copyright and not that of the new 'OhKnowledge.com', the hypothetical Wikipedia replacement. (Sherrod, however does have evidence, so don't take this as a justification for the .ch). Once a site loses connection with the old name or any registered associated material it ceases to be the same entity. Oh Internet has no parallels to the old site at all. The position that the new site is ED just 'cleaned' should be removed from the article immediately.

Encyclopedia Dramatica, as defined, is dead. OhInternet is a whole new project – a de facto successor, but not 'ED'. The redirect was an attempt to maintain website hits but as many 3rd party websites will show, it didn't quite work out. The vast majority of the volunteer editors did leave. Site activity, growth and edit numbers are much higher at encyopediadramaticia.ch than at OhInternet. OhInternet’s declining popularity should first stabilize before any 'notability' assessment goes underway. 

Understandably the nature of ED.ch is illegal so I don't care for it immediate coverage. I like to think the site will cool down over time.

The article states at Iranian calendar#Modern era from 1925 that in 1976, the Shah decreed that Solar Hejri year 1355 became the imperial year 2535. Thus the first imperial year was the year that Cyrus the Great acceded to the throne in 559 BC (not his birth year many years earlier). This would mean that during Gregorian year 2010 the imperial year 2569 would have begun if the Solar Hejri year had not been reinstated in 1978. Your year 2549 would imply a first imperial year 20 years after Cyrus began his reign, after he had conquered many nations, inducing their kings to bring him gifts. This would be even more arbitrary then the beginning of his reign, which is a well known year. His birth year is assigned to be two different years, either 600–599 BC or 576–575 BC. 

Regarding Nowruz, in Achaemenid times the official year began at Nowruz at the vernal equinox, but popular usage placed Nowruz at the summer solstice.

202,"Article reorganization 

There is a confusion between the different definitions of heterosexuality.  I think this article should be worded more like the homosexuality article, which distinguishes between homosexual orientation and same-sex relationships.  Likewise, there needs to be a distinction between people with a heterosexual orientation and people who have sexual relationships with people of the opposite gender.  I think if we reorganize the page like the homosexual page this distinction would be more clear.  For example, it would make clear that reproduction results from heterosexual sex, not from a heterosexual orientation.  On the other hand, the causality section is mostly about the development of a heterosexual orientation.  That crucial element isn't clear. I am going to start reorganizing it like the homosexuality page."

 the J-10, despite rumours is not based on the lavi, chengdu was already working on a canard plane before the lavi program. the fact that you bring this up, raise question on sources of information, i hope it is not wikipedia ) Chengdu actually got technology from US (before USSR collapse, US allow chinese engineer to come to US and work with US defence contractors, this is documented) and Russia (after). both transfer were however incomplete and Chengdu had to adsorb the technology, the fact that they got input on modern technology form the 2 major power, is what make it logical that they can develop modern planes now.

 but seeing is believing, we have video of a thottle up, thottle down test on landing http://www.tudou.com/programs/view/VDrpLi8EER0/ showing it has operational engine. also the article you read is regarding J-10 problem which is unique to single engine planes. the J-11b has been equipped with chinese engine and flying in the elite unit near beijing, it hard to dispute something already in service.

 again i remind that this is just a prototype, it is not a production type. no one here suggest they can make a 100 of these economically. but making 1 working prototype is not that hard; remember that F22 prototype emerge years before US has the ability to mass produce them, that is the whole point of making prototypes, to solve problems. i really don't understand why some are acting like the existence of prototype must mean China has reach the same level as US, that just crazy thought. 218.186.8.234  00:57, 6"

17173,"Suggested clarifications 

I think Gilles objection to using ports as classification is that it may be confused with the number of valves promoted by post petrol engine manufactures. I suggest usine 'Dual cycle' instead of 'four port' and 'Single cycle' instead of 'two port'.

The avec chariots ans sans chariots designs could be used in either layout. The AC would be better suited to an internal combution engine but would also suit say an gas pump or expander, due to the greater change in volume through the cycle. 

The possible use as an internal combustion engine has recieved the most attention. It has many more uses - pneumatic motor, steam engine, refrigerant expander, pump etc. As far as I can see development is currently focused on the 'dual cycle', which is better suited to the majority of these uses, so perhaps the 'internal comustion engine' should be presented as a simply possible use of the single cycle configuration.

Photo-detonation/HCCI/SCCI/ATAC really warrant a seperate page with a mention here that the Quasiturbine is better suited to it than current engine designs due to the quick compression rate at 'tdc'

It is theoretically possible to use different fluids in the pump, as long as cross-contamination is not a problem. You could use hydrolic oil to pump air, as long as it doesn't matter if your compressed air is full of hydrolic oil! The fact the rotor is exposed to both 'cycles', there will be a layer or oil on the face plate when it is on the 'air' side. Seals and tolerances would also have to be right for the 'thinner' fluid, meaning an increase in friction compared to puming a thicker fluid. There isn't any evidence this has been tested, however."

Stabbed Kercher getting axed
Hello, Wikid77 here. Now that User:Zlykinskyja has been hounded away from editing """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""", the wholesale axing of fully-sourced text has begun. See: removal of forensics. The apparent WP:Wikihounding of Zlykinskyja might have been as a woman, with legal expertise, trying to keep the article neutral in legal terms. I warned beware of """"colleagues gasping if they knew about editing on that lowly pedia"""". Perhaps if American student Amanda had been """"Adam Knox"""" then fewer people would want to remove sourced text disputing the evidence and 20? misquoted infamous statements. (I didn't know any evidence in December 2009, now I know much, and some seems falsified in Italy). Zlykinskyja tried to add how """"Donald Trump"""" rejected the verdict (+source), but that was quickly deleted. Some US officials are conducting a mock-trial by judge to compare verdicts, but I doubt that could be explained in the article. Then some prankster this week posted at top, """"Breaking news: Knox dead in prison from suicide, details not confirmed"""" (from an IP edit in the London area), and some say Knox cried in jail when she heard WP posted that. I wish we could split the article into several low-target subarticles (I noted Manson Family has 17 spinoff articles). The talk-page has resisted any attempt to reduce the rabid focus on """"Amanda Knox"""" and naturally, a prior subarticle was AfD deleted.However, I suggest the following:
 """"Amanda Knox"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article with civil suits, appellate trial, and college coursework in prison.
 """"Raffaele Sollecito"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article, noting he completed his computer degree while in custody, and they met, at a classical music concert, because he looked like Harry Potter.
 """"Prosecution of Amanda Knox"""" (new) - would contain all the pro/anti-Knox text, moved from edit-wars in the Kercher article.
 """"Investigations of Kercher murder"""" (new) - would be a forensic article, with fingerprints, Low copy number DNA, luminol, unidentified DNA/prints, listing exact quotes+sources, etc.
 """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""" (reduced) - would be trimmed into an overview, linking sections to subarticles.
I have seen how other articles, split into subarticles, greatly reduce the vandalism in the spinoff details, so that forensic details would likely match the sources, when viewed there. This message is just a general notice, sent to a few admins, and I don't expect an immediate response. Also, feel free to delete this, knowing it was posted in a 1 May talk-page revision: as a May Day warning about axing of Kercher text. Thanks. -  """

 Requests for comment 

 RFC/discussion of article Global warming controversy 
Hello, . As a prominent contributor to Global warming controversy, you may want to be aware that a request for comments has been filed about it. The RFC can be found by the article's name in this list, and the actual discussion can be found on Talk:Global warming controversy, in case you wish to participate. Thank you for your contributions.      
Controversy or not
Reading the article about the existence of a """"controversy"""" seems that there is not any controversy at all and instead the few not supporting human-causation in rising temperatures are outliers.

If this is the case the article seems to be unnecessary entirely.  If it is not the case then the article's balance is not to Wikipedia's standards.

Dual philosophies used in enforcement of policies, guidelines and content.
Questions seem to persists relating to the validity of sources.  On one hand sources that are not in agreement with the """"global warming conseneus"""" viewpoint are removed with the related text.  On the other hand sources that are in agreement with the """"global warming consensus"""" viewpoint are replaced.

Questions persists relating to the Wikipedia standards for handling edits.
When edits are made that are about one side of the Global Warming Controversy they are deleted or reverted with little, if any explanation.  When edits are made about the other side of the Global Warming Controversy there are attempts to """"make them better"""" instead of deletions. """

22916,"other examples 

Well I can think of other examples, for instance where supply may be artifically restricted or demand for some reason low.
For instance price regulation of pharmcuticals in the UK, an eloborate form of price ceiling:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Price_Regulation_Scheme
Or prescription charges in the UK
fixed price

Examples seem to show an increased demand where price is lowered... Though it's not hard to find examples where increasing the price has increased the demand and a good is seen as having greater value than it actually has. I think this was the case with BMW, certainly a car manufacturer, who saw sales increase when they put the price up.

There are also concepts such as 'the greater fool' where profits are the key drivers and people buy because the price is rising until such point as supply is limited by affordability, not real value (for instance stock market 'adjustments' where price is much greater than value) nor total quantity.

In those examples increased 'price' is not caused by lack of supply but supply by price."

The following comments have been deleted:

The band promotes Croatian patriotism and ultra-nationalism, and sings about topics such as the love for one's country, family and religion, but also about the hatred of Serbs and Croatian social democrats. Dealing with such topics has made the band controversial. Perković has been known to openly promote Ustaša ideology because he wears black clothes, salutes in the corresponding way and had often openly supported the Ustaše and the NDH in his statements to the media. 

Ultra-nationalism?Ultra-nationalism means that you want to destroy everything that is not of your nation.While patriotism means that you love your own nation,but you respect others.Where in his songs does he promote hate to other nations?And no mentioning songs created in time of war against the Serbs,because it was the time of war.And only mention songs written by him.Not what he is accused of performing.

 Hatred toward SDP?Where?Name source.He is right wing,that si widely known.Of course he disagrees with their politics and he considers their politics bad for Croatia,but hatred? Reliable source please.

Where does he promote openly Ustashe?Citation please.Because he wears black clothes?Are all rockers Ustashe?By this,rock 'n' roll is equal fascism.He is a rock singer,of course he wears black clothes.
Salute he uses is an old salute of Croatian nobles,that existed long before Ustashe.

Despite this, his statements confirming his support for the Ustaše actually outnumber his denouncements of this virtual NSDAP equivalent (he is noted to have publicly voiced his support for the NDH, in various degrees, to the media on at least twenty occasions). His credibility in these statements is diminished not only by this fact but also by the legal necessity to denounce any fascist movement in order to avoid further banning (or other legal action).

Again,I see that this is already discussed.Feral is not reliable,its a tabloid.Only reliable newspapers should be used.And these quotations in Feral,while they may be true,there are no links to check the meaning,because they may be taken out of contest,and they could have totally fifferent meaning ii their original contest.This is not reliable.

And one more question.A couple of months ago I translated two Perkovic's statements in Jutarnji list and Vecernji list.I've put relevant sources,links to that articles.And a picture was there also.Someone deleted all this without giving explanation on the discussion page.This is not what wikipedia is about.Any change must be explained.Shame on anyone who uses this kind of sneaky methods."

  Statement on my block 

On 27 June I was asked by Thatcher to help deal with pro-paedo bias historical articles.  

I read your post on WR. I have just dealt with a rampant sockpuppeteer User:Burrburr and friends, whose main activity is to remove such pro-pedo edits from dead historical figures. I suspect he was correct on substance but the abusive sockpuppetry (80+ accounts) was unacceptable. It would be a good thing for a knowledgeable, non-sockpuppet using editor to perform the same sort of review, as long as it is done civilly etc. The pro-pedos will find it much harder to revert someone of relatively higher status (most of Burrburr's accounts edited for only a day or two, so it was easy to label them as vandals or """"single purpose accounts"""" and deprecate their edits). This is, of course, harder to do with an established named editor. Thatcher 

For example, it was being claimed with very little properly sourced evidence that Jules Verne was a paedophile.  I did so with the help of an editor called Phdarts whose contributions I looked at and judged worthwhile.  I made a considerble number of edits to the 

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&offset;=20080629&limit;=200&target;=Hinnibilis

""""rm politics reference - wrong chapter and is misquoted anyway""""
""""rm absurdly general and unverifiable statement""""
""""rm original research""""

in which I was helped by PhD.  There was no opposition at all from the pro-paedo editors.  

Then I caught this edit to Haiduc's page

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Haiduc&diff;=222250643&oldid;=221444762

""""Like you, I am much pressed for time, though I think that matters have gone beyond personal intervention - however well-authenticated - and now demand third-party intervention (as before). """"

This 'third party intervention' was not long in coming.  Phdart's account has been blocked for sockpuppeteering.  He was, as I suspected, a reincarnation of the banned Headleydown, but I did not have a problem with that.  He was editing under my supervision, and had made many strong contributions to the encyclopedia under other accounts.  (FT2 has pointed to some abusive edits he has made, but haven't we all).

I complained bitterly on FT2's talk page and have also contributed to a thread on paedophilia subjects to the Wikipedia Review.  I did not accuse FT2 of being pro-paedophile, I said that he was 'in effect' enabling the pro-paedophile lobby on Wikipedia.  I do not see how editors with expert knowledge of this subject area can possibly continue to work under these conditions."""

What the hell? 
User:Izady is a sick fuck:

It should be noted that the conditions in which individuals died varies from site to site. The people that were buried in these graves are believed to have been members of the Kurdish population which was in support of Iranian occupancy of Iraq at the time of their death (circa 1980's) 'and who deserved to die in the hands of patriotic Sunni Arabs of Iraq'. The legitimacy of claims of atrocity are debateable for this reason, 'since Sunni Arabs are too honorable to do any such things'. The distinction between those who have died in military style combat or executed under the direction of a lawful court of President Saddam Hussein, although buried disrespectfully, and those who have been victims of genocide, ethnic cleansing or otherwise murdered innocently and buried efficiently is a bright line; mass burial should not be assumed to be evidence of criminal activity. 'These Shia and Kurds were traitors to Iraq and were fairly tried and executed by the patriot Arab Sunnis for their crimes', although the burial was not always respectful. Victims of chemical weapons are unknown, 'and they too were traitor Kurds and deserved the punishment by the patriotic Saddam government'."

The only thing I considered a revert was actually reverting when someone cheekily readded it. I reverted under WP:Libel and left the following details on AN/I:
""""I have never in my entire wiki history (or life) intently read or edited any articles or biog relating to The Troubles: it does not interest me one iota. My name on that list was defamatory and I exercised WP:Libel to remove it and to save time getting it suppressed. It's common sense and normal reasoning that we don't identify/ban someone as a sex offender without proof, and you just as equally don't list them, on a public website, where I am not anonymous, as being involved in highly contentious (and potentially incriminating) topics, which people might take literally and use against them (even life threatening). The admin was wrong in his suppositions, the underlying comparison was wrong, the warning does not apply to me. Might as well try to warn me not to war-edit in 9/11-theory, holocaust-denial or far-right political party discussions: the fact that I never have or do prevails over such notices, as does upholding AGF in acknowledging that I don't. The admin was advised of my removing the entry, and has not taken the matter any further, and neither should anyone else – let sleeping dogs lie, and no one will have excuses to cast spurious remarks.""""

Despite not having a mainspace article on me, I am a living person and have rights to privacy too, as much as any BLP. This listing is a threat to my privacy and safety under Wiki's own policy. I don't need to threaten legal riff-raff, Wikipedian's should know this is not a safe way to expose people. I feel even more exposed by it being raised again.

Perhaps easiest is to imagine an airfoil propagating through a large """"body of air"""" which is initially at rest. Once the airfoil is well inside this body of air (by several chord lengths, say 5 or more), the rate of vertical momentum change of this body of air is equal to the lift. Or more precise: the reaction force of the wing on the air (minus the lift force). At the edges of this body of air, far from the airfoil, nothing is happening. 

Small air parcels are subject to three laws:
 mass conservation: the mass of a parcel is constant. Its position, volume and shape may change. 
 Newton's laws: the 2nd law states that the rate of change of momentum is equal to the net force on the parcel. The 3rd law states that the force by one parcel on its neighbour is equal to minus the force by that neighbour on that particular parcel.
 A force model: if incompressible flow is assumed, the pressure distribution at the edge of the parcel is such that its volume does not change (but its position and shape may change). In case of a compressible fluid, pressure and volume are related through some thermodynamic equation of state (since the parcel mass is constant, a volume change implies a density change) . 
These three act together. In general the influence of the airfoil diminished with the distance from it, since the effect of the displaced volume by the moving airfoil is largest in its neighbourhood. Hope this gives some clues to pinpoint where the crux of your problem is.    21:57"""

On May 17 2006 someone changed the title of a sub-heading, without offering an explanation.  The original title was 
Captures in """"the War on Terror"""", which was changed simply to """"events"""".  I don't see how the new subheading is an improvement.  Counter-terrorism  officials executed a series of raids in Faisalabad on September 11 2002 - the anniversary of September 11, 2001 - arresting dozens of men, many of whom ended up being held in the Guantanamo Bay detainment camps.  When that series of raids is described here it will make even more sense to restore the original subheading.  Can anyone offer an explanation why the subheading should remain simply """"events""""?     """

However, I'm wondering if you're aware of the fact that there are some stringent policies about conflicts of interest on Wikipedia, to ensure that articles reflect a neutral point of view. You might like to read through Wikipedia:Conflict of interest, which gives you a run-down of this whole area. The aim is to try to maintain the encyclopaedic nature of Wikipedia, and ensure it doesn't get used for advertising or biased opinions.

The reason I asked about a reference was because of the policy outlined in Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons – there are no particular problems with your statement about the book in this article, but in general all statements in articles about living people need to be verifiable via citations to reliable published sources. This protects people like you from unfounded statements and rumours that could otherwise appear in your article (since everyone can edit Wikipedia).

 RE: Tables 

Ah, the joys of tables! I've always used DIVs and CSS for website layouts, so wikicode's HTML-like table code was all greek to me, but thankfully it's pretty simple to get the hang of ^_^ Help:Table has basically everything you could need, if you have any questions on the specifics, let me know!
DIV tags work exactly as they do in HTML, so to add inline CSS code you can just do Foobar
Userboxes are really really easy to do; either just add the template of the userbox you want to your page (e.g {{user AGF}}), or to make your own just use the Userbox template (e.g {{subst:Userbox|id=|id-c=#d0e5f5|id-fc=#000|id-s=16|info=This user is , who is learning userboxes!|info-c=#f1f5fc|info-fc=#000|info-s=8|border-c=#abd5f5|border-s=1}}
Personally I always use the Userbox template and (re)make my own userboxes, because not all ready-made userboxes are the same size, and when some are larger than others I think it looks messy. Also, I like to have them all using my colour scheme ^_^ But it's really just down to personal preference.
{{user AGF}} will give you:

Let me tell you that there has been no such thing called """"tamil brahmin"""" or ethnic """"tamil"""" as """"people"""" understand the term now. all these partisanship has been late medieval age concotion of vested interests. It is very very interesting to note here that many of those who claim to be """"brahmins""""(numerous sects of the same actually sramanas(buddists and jains) of past) now may not have been so. So you were right in questioning as to if the word iyer could be confused with word liar."""

10599,"Accuracy of these arms 

I would question the accuracy of these arms. 

Also, many of the arms below are entirely novel or recent innovations, replacing existing arms either formally granted to counties i.e. County Councils since the 1899 Local Government Act or since independence and arms associated with counties since time immemorial. As such, I reckon former  County Arms ought to be given, as well as modern emblems (Kerry and Armagh, to name but a few). 

Where no arms existed, the arms of the County Town was used: Castlebar for Co. Mayo, or Athlone for Co. Westmeath. I would indicate these with an example. 

Dates of formal adoption should be given also.

The arms of County Dublin I believe pre-date the 19th Century (I could be wrong) and I would indicate the Fingal, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and South Dublin are successors."

Yes, I do and they are written by the people in both my books """"Destiny Matrix"""" and """"Space-Time and Beyond II"""" that you refuse to look at or recognize as legitimate. North Beach in San Francisco is a small community and many people know the story as they wiitnessed it. Here are e-mail addresses of some key witnesses you can contact about this matter of simple fact:
LMCLEARIE7@aol.com Lorna McClearie - she was Gary Zukav's significant other at the time. There is a photo of her and Gary in Space-Time and Beyond II at that time. She is completely aware of the facts. She was there.
lensman137@sbcglobal.net  Kim Burrafato - he was there at the time,
jagdish.mann@gmail.com  Jagdish Mann - he was there at the time,
d14947@gmail.com  David Gladstone - he was there at the time,
rmt@protium.de Randy Tinkerman - he was there at the time,
dwishnie@aol.com - he was there at the time,
sirag@mindspring.com Saul-Paul Sirag - he was there at the time and he also advised Gary on the editing and physics content
fred@fredalanwolf.com  Fred Alan Wolf - he was there at the time
rebeccapaxton@mac.com  Lee Myers - he was there at the time. Lee does not do e-mail, his wife Becky Paxton does it for him.
BTW I never submitted any of my books since 2002 to a regular publisher and I turned down a contract offer from a major German publisher for the German edition of """"Destiny Matrix"""". I will eventually hire a professional writer to cull the popular pieces from all of my books into a popular book that will be published mainstream. These books I am doing now are simply my preliminary sketch books, like Leonardo's - keeping notes for the historical record. As such many people will find them interesting. Also, as I don't need the money, I have not been doing what authors usually do to promote their books. I am too busy creating new content right now. Remember I am in Star Trek and on some major TV Shows and on IPOD Radio with RU Sirius and will be doing more of that bye and bye. If I wanted to go the usual route I could. I simply have not tried because I am not ready to do so. That is the fact.  -)

Where in  my edit to I call him the """"greatest"""" Where? WHERE? That's YOU reading into his achievements as offered by the history itself. My opinions as a fan are not in there in laudatory language. Stuff that was dramatic is now long gone or will be gone.  You are claiming that I say in the article that """"he began it all and towers over everybody else."""" WHERE? I don't. You are making things up. I mention the groups and the people he worked alongside as well but as this hugely famous person he stepped away from performing and became a full time activist!

Overstate what? He was as great and renowned athlete of the day as Pollard or Thorpe! Are you now negating reams of history and rewriting it too??? Where do you have this right? You don't.

Ok, here we go again:
""""That HUAC went after Communists (and little after those other groups) might have something to do with the fact that the Cold War involved a Communist empire, not a Nazi one.""""

The Cold War also involved brutal lynchings, Jim Crow, intimidation of blacks and union members of all races, civil liberties violations and segregationist leadership and members of congress, not to mention world wide human rights abuses, rape of resources, thefts, colonialist thievery, ethnic calseasing of people of color on four continents!

Some called for the leaders of the Ku Klux Klan to be interrogated by the HUAC. Martin Dies however was a supporter of the Klan and had spoken at several of its rallies. Other members of the HUAC such as John Rankin and John S. Wood were also Klan sympathizers. Wood defended the Klan by arguing that: """"The threats and intimidations of the Klan are an old American custom, like illegal whiskey-making.""""
Eventually Ernest Adamson, the HUAC's chief counsel, announced that: """"The committee has decided that it lacks sufficient data on which to base a probe."""" John Rankin added: After all, the KKK is an old American institution."""" Instead, the HUAC concentrated on investigating the possibility that the American Communist Party had infiltrated the Federal Writers Project and other New Deal projects.""""

I mean come on! If you truly believe that """"HUAC went after Communists (and little after those other groups) beacuse it might have something to do with the fact that the Cold War involved a Communist empire, not a Nazi one"""" you have not read ANY cold war civil rights history. They nver went after them WHEN we were at war. The US has NEVER gone after neo nazis/KKK/hate groups in even a remotely close fashion/dedication as they have to Leftits. Non-government groups and people have done the leg work for them.

I thank that's generalising too much. It wasn't just the right that isolated Robeson in the 1950s but a broad political spectrum.
WHITEWASH. Who and what was this broad spectrum?  Please? Isolated FROM is not the factor while ISOLATED BY IS! Apart from liberals who were scared away eventually who else was it then? And who instigated his blacklisting and persecution? the daily harassment and surveillances that were ceaseless, that led TO the isolation itself? You are reverting history no just this article.

I just don't want to have the basic fact that he supported (whatever the details) that political system to be swept under the carpet under romantic notions of """"socialist experiment"""".

IT IS NOT SWEPT UNDER. The USSR is in there it is just not the whole article and it '''was an experiment''' when he arrived in 1934, less than two DECADES after the revolution. People can make up their own minds

 AndyTheGrump, Is THE REFERENCED AND PUBLISHED Decision of EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECtHR) not a PUBLISHED RELIABLE Source? Notice that I am giving the ECtHR reference DIRECTLY from OFFICIAL ECtHR website. 212.174.38.3   

 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event 
This must be added to the article:
On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.
However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 212.174.38.3

 PREP vs. Quick Count 

The text of the article suggests (and states overtly at least once) that the PREP and the Quick Count are the same thing. They are most definitely not. 

The Quick Count (""""Conteo Rapido"""", as opposed to the PREP, """"Programa the Resultados Electorales Preliminares""""), was a statistical sampling model of several polling places. It was meant as a statistical tool of prediction. The results from the Quick Count, which were made public some days later, showed that the statistical tests showed Calderon as winning in all three, but in two of them the difference was within the margin of error and in the third it was only barely outside. It was because of this, as per prior agreement, that the IFE declared the race too close to call (the prior agreement was that the IFE would either state which candidate was projected to be the winner based on the Conteo Rapido, or ask for a couple more hours to collate more results, or declare the race too close to call). The Quick Count was not the PREP. As it happens, the final tally agreed with the Quick Count results.

The PREP on the other hand is the quick dissemination of full results as reported by the district electoral councils to the IFE. There is no statistical component to the PREP, as opposed to the Quick Count which is an entirely statistical analysis of results.

See for example , in which Ugalde speaks of making the results from the Quick Count known, and whether the tecnical committee felt it would be possible to determine the electoral tendencies at the time.  Another note is in:

19003,"so all that needs to be measured is their importance; and since it tends to be men that like to assert just how big and important they are, the only dispute that remains to be settled is whether to measure volume or length. Unfortunately, taking the arithmetic mean of these may produce different winners (if you are unconvinced, compare the hypothetical data sets of {2,2,2} and {1,1,3}). However, in a flash of inspiration, I've realized that so long as you take the geometric mean both results will always agree! (Hey, not only do you get to argue about naming disputes, you get to learn some maths, isn't Wikipedia educational?) Macedonian on the other hand will require me to measure neither length nor volume, but genuine Macedonicity. To this end, I could travel around all areas and entities that have been declared by either side to be truely Macedonian, and measure the Macedonicity of men's penises using my special patented Macedonicitymeter. The risk is this won't be perceived as neutral, because the losing side may claim that I have been measuring the wrong kind of Macedonicity. The important point here (I think there is actually is one) is that sometimes it's not importance which is at the heart of the dispute, but historical and moral rights to claim the name. It's easier when the other side isn't still around (I dread to think of the rows we'd have if the Albania in the Caucasus was still around to claim the name!) but if it is, arguing about how big and important both sides are is going to help even less. On an unrelated issue, what language was that?

 Blanco, Hitler and Mussolini 

Just some small factual stuff, in the section Spain After Franco, it is said that Adm. Blanco was killed by a car bomb, but he wasn't, the ETA had instead placed a bomb in a tunnel underneath the car and exploded it as Blanco drove on the street above.

Also, in the section Relationship with Hitler and Mussolini, it says: """"While Franco ruled undemocratically, he seems to have reluctantly accepted that Spain would be a democracy after his death."""" This isn't true at all, the only reason Franco worked with the western democracies was because Spain was in dire need of the supplies they could provide for Spain's weak economy, and later on, during the 50's and 60's, it was because Franco's advisors realized the need for Spain to take place in the burgeoning international economy. Franco was a devout enemy of democracy, and thought throughout his entire life that it would lead to anarchy or communism."""

True. Both libertarians and conservatives in the modern Western world want low taxes, small government and individual freedom and responsibility. However, the difference is that libertarianism is a fixed ideology, while conservatism as an ideology varies between time periods and societies; for instance, nineteenth-century conservatism was about preserving monarchical and aristocratic rule and was totally different from modern conservatism. I think the quote I added to the first paragraph sums that up quite well: """"who are the 'conservatives' in today's Russia? Are they the unreconstructed Stalinists, or the reformers who have adopted the right-wing views of modern conservatives such as Margaret Thatcher?

6050,"It is just like synthpop being a precursor to techno. Synthpop is white music whilst Techno is black music. Radio Babylon is dub, it provides typical dub technique (small room/overreverbed room), and the only thing it can be called 'dnb' for is the combination of percusion with k-s-k-s-.. rhythm, which is hardly an invention of MBM. Four arguments to Radio Babylon opposition are:
MBM is an experimental band. (there has been already noted somewhere that Kraftwerk's 'Radioactivity' was once 'recognized' a first dubstep track by some)
Dub is a genre of vast (Can you definetely state no simillar dubtrack has been written just before /or much before Radio Babylon?)
MBM's track isn't related to Rave, as Dub (or reverb technique) isn't related to Rave
Two years passed till another tracks of jungle have appeared if Radio Babylon is considered a first track.

Arguments in favour are:
MBM are British, so they are connected somehow to British Rave scene.
Track's rhythm is quite a simillarity with jungle music rhythms.

Second argument is like 'drumfunk was created in the times jazz/funk drum improvisations appeared (20s to 60s)'. The first argument is weak without the second one.

One more argument that MBM's track is sampled in some jungle tracks as a straight shortcut to jungle music roots according to creators of those tracks. But it is quite a pov argument.

I don't know the roots of Rave, the scene was dominantly white, and the guy who brought acid house to UK was white too. But who started using 45rpm breakbeat over 4-tofloor is enigma to me personally.

Black music may be considered a 'racial term', therefore i think you'll enjoy more politcorrect one: 'Pop music genre created by black people of African/Carribean (may be also Indian) origin'. I asure, no one here wants it to start any racial war.  82.209.225.33"

Thanks. After the moderator bug happened a couple of days ago, one non-mod was able to modify the welcome page and have his changes realised within VP, and then there was some chat in IRC about how easy it would be to get by my """"security."""" The mod bug resulted from problems in reading the page history (I'll spare you the technical details), and if someone managed to move the page along with its history, it would be very simple for anyone to edit the resulting redirect to include their username and have his changes realized (as well as to disable the tool for everyone else, except for me of course =)). And especially since I'm now adding this """"revert all user contributions"""" feature in the next release, I'm getting a little concerned about abuse. S-protecting's probably not neccessary at all, but I figured it wouldn't hurt anyone; the page move protection, however, could save me and other editors a lot of headaches. If you feel the need to add the template, would it be possible to add it further down the page (in the command's section) or on the talk page? Do you list userpages on WP:PP? I can think of quite a few admins with protected userpages, and it doesn't seem particularly vital to alert others when pages in userspace are protected, but I wouldn't object to your listing it there. As I said before, s-protection isn't really too necessary, so if you'd rather it just be move-protected, feel free to lift the semiprotection. Thanks again for your help! It's much appreciated.

I've found dozens of articles that have listings of people from shows to parades to other activities and events considered """"significant"""". you go around following articles some editors contribute on and put notices at the top and remove their work, even after it's been there for years all cus you're a sore pussy loser with no dick. you suck off other men to make yourself feel better about how much of a loser you are. you think you're important going and undoing work. I have a zillion ips and i'm an admin. I could take you down but i'll do that off this site. you're gonna wish you never fucked with me and my crew on here. you're a meaningless worthless dick head. you are a piece of shit. fuck off and die, I won't read your stupid notices or replies. fuck off, I could care less.

14410,"""I rode on the Nindawayma back in the summer of '89.  Of course that was many years ago now, and she was in a lot better shape back then.  The rumours about her not being able to handle the rough weather are true, which is why she was only in service during the high-peak months of July-August.  She indeed did have a lot of mechanical problems-mostly eletrical and hydraulic related, but yes her engines(Pielstick's) were also fussy and burned an obscene amount of fuel.  Ontario Northland, who were/are the former owners, took a huge financial loss as they paid $13 million for the vessel, while she was only in service for four seasons, from 1989-1992.  In contrast, the Chi-Cheemaun has been in service for 32 years now.  Meanwhile, the """"big canoe"""" is spending the winter in Sarnia, Ontario undergoing a major refit which reportedly includes new engines, stabilizers, and some interior modifications as well.

Is Wikipedia a patriarchal site? If it isn't, may I then ask why a photo of a woman reading the Quaran is constantly removed by Islamists and no-one bothers to do anything about it? I hope you are aware that this encyclopedia is opened to all people, including extremists and even terrorists. Why do your admins allow these extremists have their way? They argue that if certain people are offended of seeing a woman reading the Quaran, then perhaps the photo should be removed. Even the photographer has been convinced to have the photo removed and now he thinks it's his fault. Here's what he said: 

My wife is particularly saddened that a picture of her is causing distress - she compares it to an image of a woman in a small bikini holding a bible in the Bible article - and she has asked that the photo be removed from the article. I personally feel that the image belongs in Timur, where the woman is needed in the image in order to show scale (at least until a replacement image of the folio with a different person is found), but that it is inappropriate to include it in the Qur'an article.

Does this sound normal to you? So if these extremists, whom I dared to call Talebans, are offended by women, then perhaps we should not have woman editors, admins, etc? I suggested to you a month ago that you need to impose more Liberal standards to Wiki and enforce them with the sword! Ban these people, please! Your admins removed my line where I called these extremists for Talebans. How shameful! Here's the photo.

I appreciate this.  I reverted  with just that 1 sentence 1 source addition.  I then requested to discuss it at the Talk page.  Question  So should I have first discussed it at the Talk page, and then asked it was acceptable for the article?  I thought on wikipedia I'm free to add something, and then discuss it.  Also, they reverted me.  I added the simple 1 sentence, and they reverted me 5+ times.  I'm not sure why the focus is on me warring with them, because they reverted me.  Could you clarify this?  Again, I added the simple sentence and national source (Outside Magazine) and I then asked to discuss it, and they reverted it 5+ times.  MONGO cited reasons such as the person is deceased, that the person took """"only 1 pill"""" of the prescription steroid (Outside article is on the use of steroids for performance enhancing on Everest), he commented in the Talk section that I should not be against the mountaineer, etc.  These all seem very unacceptable.  Highly biased journalism.  Almost laughably so.  And he didn't care to discuss it.  Fact:  The climber was reveled by Outside to have taken it, the Outside article is on """"Climbers Little Helper"""", subtitled """"a dangerous trend in mountaineering: rampant use of performance-enhancing drugs, particularly the powerful steroid dexamethasone.""""

And, he got away with it, even with administrators who laughed with him about it all.  They do derisory posts, give each other barnsters, and laugh about their control over a novice wikipedia user.

Tips on vandalizing this article

The best way to complain about a nonexistent, vague plan to do something you can't define is to post your boring opinions on Wikipedia. It doesn't matter that the existence of any """"North American currency union"""" is part of a larger insane conspiracy theory involving Jews, aliens, and Bush doing WTCgo ahead and have a furious debate about something imaginary, muck like two nerds standing outside a comic book store arguing about whether the Hulk can beat up Superman. Under no circumstances should you worry about the war in Iraq, the repressive enforcement of American drug laws, cronyism in the Justice Department, or discrimination against homosexuals in marriage lawsissues with actual relevance to justice and prosperity in America have no place in Fictitious Debate Land. It's important that the people who obsess enough about politics to put unreadable chunks of diarrhea into Wikipedia articles about their pet political theories be the most uninformed and uninsightful people in the world regarding actual political issues.

In all seriousness: there is no North American currency union, there is no plan to create one, the only place it exists is in science fiction. It is unworthy of an article at all, and having one just shows how far Wikipedia is gone into the thrall of conspiracy theorists and obsessive autistic nerds who can't figure out what is and is not important.

Vandalism Manifesto. Pass to all Wikians

VANDALISM IS GOOD. Vandalism does not come from a sheer desire to cause harm.
Vandals do their thing all over Wiki, 24/7, from frustration and hatred, 
because incompetent """"editors"""" who have no skills, no degrees, no expertise, usually no names, have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others.
Vandalism is a good and natural response to no-lifers (as in Get a Life) who 
do 7000 edits, 10,000 edits a year and who have actual Watch Lists of 1,300
or more and are proud of it. These jerks deserve have their own pages vandalized, over and over as long as they are in effect, vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop. Vandals keep no-life editors, admins, 
bureaucrats and stewards honest, or at least busy, reverting the reverts they get on their own pages. VANDALISM IS GOOD. It helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns. The Culture of Wikipedia is very,very sick,

 Tips for developing country outlines 

Instructions for developing country outlines is located at  

 A note concerning redlinks... 

Many of the entries (and their links) are standard across all of the country outlines, to aid readers, especially young readers, in comparing countries to each other.

So if this country doesn't have any of a particular entry, like navies, please don't delete the entry.  Instead, complete it with """"none"""" (and a brief explanation as to why, for example, """"- x is a landlocked country with no ports"""").  If the explanation exists in an article on Wikipedia, then click on the redlink and create a redirect to that location.  See Wikipedia:Redirect, WP:Section linking, and Help:Section#Section_linking.

Standard redlinks (article names) were also chosen based on how country coverage tipically expands.  This makes the standard names for these subtopics widely available and easily accessible.  So please do not remove those redlinks, for they will turn blue eventually.  In the meantime, they can be redirected to the section of whatever article has the relevant information, if any.  See Wikipedia:Redirect, WP:Section linking, and Help:Section#Section_linking.

Thank you.The Transhumanist    

P.S.: To discuss the standard design of the country outlines, or of outlines in general, do so on the Outline of knowledge WikiProject talk page.

 Guidelines for outlines 

Guidelines for the development of outlines are being drafted at User:The Transhumanist/Outline of knowledge.

Your input and feedback is welcomed and encouraged.The Transhumanist    

 Please check and fix the government section 

The government section needs to be checked for accuracy.  The initial data placed in the government branches sections was generated by template, and the data didn't fit all countries.

Wikipedia is, above all, an encyclopedia, and its articles should only use reliable, third-party, published sources. Editors like  and  seek to undermine the integrity of those reliable sources by using all sorts of trickery and deception to inject unsourced promotional bits and pieces in an obvious attempt to sanitize the article which, I believe, is reflective of the ways and character of their leader and organization as a whole.

I've been working on articles on basketball coaches, which led to wanting  to see who will be in the American Athletic Conference next season, which led me to wodnering who wrote that well-researched article, so I decided to see who was working on it, which led me to you.

I noticed you have a lot of interest in birds, and I'm trying to figure out how to respond to an OTRS email which involves birds, so here goes. Someone has provided an image that they believe are Ruddy Shelducks in Texas, and believes that is unusual.

Well Maybe theres a reason it was taken off. I think its because her voice isnt as good as it used to be. but still I say her range is Bb2-G#7 but all that can be proven is a range of C3-G#7. C3 is the lowest note in My All, Emotions, You're So Cold, and I believe other songs. A1 is my lowest note and F7 is my highest and Im a Lyric Baritone. I don't know if Mariah has ever sang above the piano or in the second octave because there is no audio to prove it. All I know is alot of people exaggerate her voice alot. Notes should be checked before saying what they are. People start rumors about alot of things like the note in You're So Cold being G2. Its not. My way of checking notes is by using a keyboard. its pretty accurate too. Its better than a tuner. Tuners can be thrown off by the slightest extra sound. the best way to check a note using a tuner is to copy the note by singing it yourself. But keyboards are easy cause it wont produce a note an octave lower or anything as most people tend to do if they feel a note is too high or an octave higher if the note is too low. You should always check a note yourself and ask another person if you can rely on them.  06:27"

If you really beleive all that Shia crap, then good luck to you, cuz you're gonna need it in life.  You don't seem to have a solid grip on reality.  You seem to live in your own world. Anyhow, I will give you a bit of clue free of charge.  The reason there are some favourable Hadiths for Iranians is, surprise surprise, because out of the 6 main Hadith authors, 4 were Iranians, including the 3 most authoritative ones:  Bukhari, Termezi and Hajjaj.  Nasai was also Iranian.  The first 3 were Khurasani, and Nasai was from Pars.  The other 2 Hadith authors are not as major and their works are basically a copy-and-paste from the Hadith of the Iranian authors.  Hajjaj was from Neyshapour but claimed to be of Qushayri origin, so that he was better accepted as some """"real Arab"""" from an authentic Arabic origin, but there is academic information that he was indeed of Khorasani origin, and his claim of """"al-Qushayri"""" roots is unverifiable.  The most authoritative of the Hadiths is al-Bukhari (from the city of Bukhara).  Having read what you wrote for me, I have reason to believe that someone like you is out of touch with reality and I am not even going to accept an edit war with someone like you. So I let you be happy by deleting the """"forced"""" out of the article, and stay happy with your romanticism and keep thinking that Shahrbanoo indeed chose Husayn and they """"lived happily ever after!"""", and both Ali and Muhammad knew Persian, and """"Shahrbanoo realized that they had special knowledge""""!! hehe no wonder your nation is the way it is today, their """"educated"""" people are like you, I can imagine what the uneducated ones are like!!  -)   22:15, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)"""

Some Mexican editors seem to consider that 9 to 15 million people in Mexico are ethnically Spanish. To support this they offer:
 a Tour operator page about tourism in Mexico: roughly as unreliable as it gets. But even worse...
 a link to the Encyclopaedia Britannica which simply does not have anything even remotely similar to the 9 to 15 million claim.

However, all that is not the real problem. The real problem is this: what have all those millions to be counted as ethnically Spanish? Note that we alrady had a discussion in About Regions with significant populations, where there was an agreement to erase the figures of Spanish people based exclusively on presumed ancestry and white race.

 If the reason to include someone as part of the Spanish people is simply ancestry, the amount for Mexico and other Latinamerican countries would probably get near 100% of the population... rather preposterous.
 If the reason are cultural traits, then we should know which are those traits, how they are different between individuals and what statistics we have about them.
 If the reason is whatever I can't think of, please enlighten me!

Alan, I'm not sure what you think is compromised ... could you clarify? The core issue we are discussing relates to the template/contents of an Integral portal page that actually reflects the integral movement as it exists. AQAL is one author's (Ken Wilber's) name for his particular developmental model. It is already described in the wikipedia's Ken Wilber article and nobody has suggested that a separate page be added for it. The issue is whether thinkers who call themselves integral and are generally understood and acknowledged as """"integral thinkers"""", doing work that is called """"Integral Studies"""", can simply be identified in the Integral portal page as such, no matter what their particular sect or affinity, (which is all that I have suggested), or whether such thinkers need to be divided a priori into pro-Ken Wilber and anti-Ken Wilber camps, or """"Integral (AQAL)"""" and """"Integral"""", as it seems you may now be proposing. Obviously term AQAL (or even Wilberian for that matter) can be used inoccuously to describe Wilber's own writings. But how does a wikipedia editor decide that a work that calls itself integral (not AQAL) is not suitable for an integral portal page but only an AQAL portal? Even I did so once, as you noted. But it is quite another for a wikipedia editor to declare that certain thinkers or books cannot be linked or acknowledged at an integral portal but only an AQAL portal, based on some subjective interpretation of their use of elements of AQAL theories. I still do not see an answer for whether you would allow Robert Kegan into the integral portal or whether you would insist that he be listed under AQAL only, and I could ask the same question about dozens of writers who cite Wilber as one of many influences. Without a principled and objective answer, I think you are asking wikipedia editors to step into a totally untenable position. As I wrote earlier:
...usually thinkers use some aspect of Wilber's thought combined with the thought of many other sources, seldom use every feature of AQAL, and often disagree about key points. On what basis do you insist that people who call their thought integral actually be considered Wilberian? How much of Wilber's thought must one agree with to be so classified, and who decides? When you acknowledge that a thinker such as Robert Kegan has """"mutually influenced"""" Wilber and yet is part of the integral school of thought, would you propose to create a new Integral portal for such hard-to-classify thinkers, and segregate every thinker that displays too much affinity to Wilber or his model into a separate category, either explicitly called """"Integral theory (Wilberian)"""" or """"Integral theory"""" (but with the Wilberian association implicit, with a wikipedia editor such as yourself presumably determining whether every new thinker is sufficiently anti-Wilber to be listed in the main category)? 
I have not proposed that AQAL be used as a synonym for integral at all, only that any thinker who describes their work as integral and is generally acknowledged as such by independent sources be listed or linked at the integral portal in an appropriate fashion. Since, perhaps, some 90% of thinkers describing themselves as integral today are influenced to one degree or another by Wilber, the consequence of using the term integral in a neutral, objective way as I have proposed may very well be that many themes and ideas treated at the integral portal will be connected to AQAL in some fashion. Again, I will say that in my opinion the right place for your concern about AQAL being inappropriately used as a synonym for integral is in reviewing the content of the pages rather than in denying the usefulness of an integral portal at all.

 What 

The fuck is going on here................ I don't even know if I should bother trying to fix this or just use my second account permanently. Shit, Indrian and Times probably playing some shit game here pretending to act like me and got all this shit on my page. I knew there was something wrong with those assholes when i saw them the first time. Guess I'll have to abandon this account. Hey  you still need to learn how to read links! Don't think I forgot! This isn't funny asshole! Guess what? I have been using another account and you don't even know what it is since the very first time I was blocked! Ha, keep playing your games, you aren't preventing me from editing piece of shit. Oh and  don't think I forgot about your 5 year old temper issues when anyone tries and fixes issues with your precious Dreamcast punk ass bitch. Lol, you guys did a number on this account. Probably found out what program I was using for the first BS account you made. 

I am impressed with how much damage you have done to this account, but it really means nothing when I am still editing every day on my personal internet and you have no idea which account it is. Oh and no it's not using a proxy or a public wifi spot. Heck, I may even try reporting this, all you idiots did was use proxy's, if I post on this account on my personal connection, and THEN appeal this I might just get my account back and get you idiots banned. I know exactly what you are going to do after this to wait until I log off, and then pounce with a new account. Sadly, looking at all this crap in my talk page, an admin would have to be retarded to not see how many of these """"accounts"""" that are proxies and not actual connections. You can only hide the smell of rotten fish for awhile before someone notices.

Shit, may was well clean this shit up. 

Oh wait a second one more thing, , what kind of retarded admin are you when having a bunch of almost all accounts pretending to be me are all on proxies and not ONE of them acts like me (did you even see my history?), and not one uses a real connection? Got that brain damage you do. had to put that in bold to be clear. Warning me about an indefinite block, lol, what does that matter, you already screwed up noticing what a 5 year old would have noticed by now. Any person would be frustrated by the silliness of this nonsense. I would appeal but something tells me to much shit damage and retarded admins will make this impossible, and I would rather not use the IP of my other account (using a real connection n my personal internet) because then you guys will probably be jackass and deleted for fun, look at this page! All this shit and nothing clicked in your small head? Amazing wikipedia. 

Also I need to take note to stay away from low ranked video game pages and focus on popular until you guys get tired of the act.

Also I KNOW you guys got an account that is going to post a bit after I submit this post I SAW him and he did the EXACT same thing 3 of the duded did, you guys need help, I can't believe not one guy was not like """"this shit don't make sense"""" for a whole second. Amazing.

Alright, so clean this page and leave this message here. Erase other extra crap. Alright, looks like we are in business. BTW, I know this is probably bull, but if any of you two actually are not trolling, which is highly unlikely, than post request an admin to come by so I can clear this account up. But I have this sinking feeling you guys all knew what's been going on here this whole time, and I have no patience to search through tons of pages to find ONE contact I can talk to about this block, so you might have this account, but you won't get the other one. Suck doesn't it? Until then, I will be going about my day and you guys will most likely probably still be doing this for X amount of days cause I guess you think it's funny? Yeah.

Of course the original stuff that i wrote on Interrelated Demand and Supply should probably go somewhere on Elasticity or Complementary Goods, but i wanted to provide more information without sullying the neat and organized data on those above two pages, so i'd created another page and hope someone tidies it up a bit and merges it with the other articles.

Things are not this simple.

Also Iraq's status as a US ally (leave alone major US ally) is questionable, due to the strong ties to Iran of many leading Shi'a and Kurdish figures and the growth increasing influence of Muqtada al-Sadr's political party. Also the insurgency is far from quelled, although it's not as deadly as it was around 2006-2007, with at least 4,000 civilians, 900 security forces killed this year it is still one of the most deadly insurgencies on earth.  19:26, 4 January 2011"

Hey Joey, how are you doing? I new your opinion on the status of 2 users. 
If you remember, on September 4 I sent I sent M.Mario a message for a month of inactivity and ihis status became semi-active. Since then, he has made 2 edits: one on September 30 on Arizona's page and then yesterday on A change Is Gonna Come yesterday but to become active again he had to make 5 edits over the course of 2 weeks. Despite his 2 edits, he did not make the 5 required and the two he made it didn't happen in the 2 weeks following the notification, only recently. My question is: am I right to have sent him a new message to notify him his inactivity of 2 months? Or did I have to wait one more week to see if he would have done 3 more edits? Does the user that becomes semi-active have to make the required edits in the 2 weeks following the notification or do we count starting the moment he makes a new edit? Do you understand my questions lol? If I should have waited then I'll erase my message...
Also, I forgot to send Mattom 123 an semi-active user notification on September 28. I could send him now a message but the problem is that he edited the ninth season today and on October 1 so if I send him a message it would be weird because now he has made edits. Is it ok if I don't send him anything?"

Comment
I have stayed away from this discussion for a couple of days, minded to retire from Wikipedia.  I'll postpone that idea a while.  There is an important issue here.

Does anyone wonder why this page suddenly became the focus of attention?  From 2003 until July 17 2011 the length of this talk page grew to 17,726 bytes.  Since August 29 it has grown by 74,997 bytes (before this post).  Meanwhile the List of castles in Wales remains rather neglected, and there is no sign of new individual county pages of castles in England getting extra attention.

A glance up this talk page to see what was written here before August 29 2011 will reveal unfailingly polite discussion.  Here is a sample of what has been written recently:

""""The professional attitude towards the current article has been lost to ego...  As this is a shameful topic opened by Paravane...  Paravane, you are ignorant and I'm tired of your possessive behaviour, against ownership guidelines... Clearly you are not competent in terms of reasonably developing an article to support the wider community... This article is a sham - a bloated mess, with weak keys, many images, and shoddy management. You have done nothing in terms of AGF of those making edits, or suggestions and continue to pursue your own mis-guided approach... As for FLC - they wouldn't touch this with a barge pole... splitting... removes the current possessive ownership attitudes which haunt the article...""""

Two points in particular deserve consideration:
Some editors, faced with what appears very plainly to be a personal campaign against them, will opt to retire from Wikipedia, and especially if personal attacks are seen to achieve their purpose.
If reason is not the sole - or even the principal - mechanism of advancing a campaign, it cannot be depended upon that reason will ever be sufficient to counter it.  If the campaign is obsessive, every line of reasoning will be dismissed by every possible means, and the campaign may be carried for no better reason than its opponents weary of arguing. 
A practice of ignoring the breakdown of mutual respect, as a basis for cooperation in the community, can hardly fail to be damaging to Wikipedia.   """
14159,"If I believed you it would be fine.  But what has happened for SIX MONTHS is that the article will be at least acceptable then some jagoff comes along and edits it and adds perjorative shit and I have to argue it all over again.  That is unacceptable on every level.  It is the cult's responsibility to make sire the content is not actionable, not mine.  Now the cult will have to contend with something different- what will they do when they are exposed at work, or with family members, as being part of a porn king's online cult.  The conversation is fine, Brad.  The problem is that this shit makes me crazy because some ignorant freak will come along and quote something from here as if it were true and then I have to deal with it.  No more- they want to gather shit on me, I will gather shit on you all."

Ignore that, I was looking up something using Twinkle (an automated script) and I didn't intend to tag the article. Anyways, I think I've replied to everything, and I think we're pretty much agreeing on most things. As for any strife between UKRD and SABRE, I'll just state that there's been plenty of ill-will and bad feelings between UKRD and USRD/CRWP, more so with USRD. Several editors, spearheaded by Jeni, have taken any opportunity at international collaboration and problem-solving as an opportunity to claim anti-American sentiments and scream that we're anti-British. (That's why I commented the way I have about SABRE, because I truly want to cover the group in an appropriate manner, but I don't want to be accused of being anti-British.) I'm sure they feel the same about us in reverse. For the most part though, UKRD is pretty quiet and inactive these days, CRWP (Canadian Roads WikiProject) is a bit more active and USRD is quite active. We're in the middle of a stub-reduction drive with the goal to expand 2011 stubs in the year 2011. (Yes, that's a lot of articles, but we have over 10,000 articles so far in the US, not counting lists.)
There's an IRC channel devoted to the roads projects on Wikipedia. Details on accessing it are at WP:HWY/IRC, but suffice it to say that most of the time it's mostly Americans in there and Zoe from the UK. We have a regular Canadian editor as well, but he's not always around. Discussion varies between other topics besides roads like sports and politics, but we do discuss a fair amount about the Wikipedia articles too. All are welcome to join us.  →  """

RfA thanks
My RfA at school play with me...|thumb|right|140px]]
Thank you for your participation in my recent RfA, which closed successfully. I felt the process was a thorough review of my contributions and my demeanor, and I was very gratified to see how many editors took the time to really see what I'm about and how I can be of help to the project. As a result, some editors changed their views during the discussion, and most expressed specific, detailed points to indicate their opinion (whether it was , , or ).

A number of editors were concerned about my level of experience. I was purposeful in not waiting until a particular benchmark occurred before requesting adminship, because I feel - as many do - that adminship is not a reward and that each case is individual. It is true that I am not the most experienced editor around here, but I appreciate that people dug into my contributions enough to reach the conclusion that I seem to have a clue. Also, the best thing about this particular concern is that experience is something an editor - or administrator - can always get more of, and I'll continue doing that, just as I've been doing. (If I seem a little slow at it, feel free to slap me.)
I intend to keep my """"dirty, dirty violator face"""" clean from now on -) 
I am a strong believer in the concept that this project is all about the content, and I'm looking forward to contributing wherever I can. Please let me know if I can be of any help. In the meantime, I'm off to school...

Thanks again!"""

23731,"""==Should this page be unprotected?==

 Unprotect Augusto Pinochet - See Talk:Augusto Pinochet. Veriverily isn't explaining his objections to text he keeps reverting over and over again.  
The page is already protected. Is this a request for unprotection?  
Yes, please unprotect this page.  
Sorry, but in spite of your efforts I don't think the discussion has reached enough of a resolution right now to avoid a resumption of the revert war as soon as the page is unprotected.  
Veriverily only chooses to lodge personal attacks against me as long as he manages to censor any facts that he feels might reflect negatively on the U.S. by means of a page protection. There cannot be a discussion unless the page protection is lifted. If we have to wait for Veriverily, the page might as well be protected permanently.  
Refer to the large number of people who have put effort into this article - Ed Poor, Cadr, Cantus, Eloquence - while 172 seeks to sabotage our efforts at working together and impose his own agenda.  The Talk pages are available, so one can see 172 is lying.  Although I have aired my frustration with 172 several times there, the issues have also been much discussed by me and others (i.e., """"only"""" yeah right).  As Cadr said on this very page ,  """"Agree with VV. A lot of constructive work was being done on the page; the problems are almost enitrely down to the user he mentions."""" (in ref to 172)  As soon as the protection is off, 172 will continue his activities.  V

Unprotect Augusto Pinochet. Cadr and Veriverily refuse to back down one inch, and no one else seems to be paying any attention. Is this page just going to be protected indefinitely?  

See brief discussion below and, for the patient, that at Talk:Augusto Pinochet.  It tells a very different story. - V 
To summarize, it is 172 who refuses to budge and alter one word of the intro he wrote.  All other parties have written several draft intros each to try to accommodate objections and concerns.  172 dismisses these efforts as """"partisan bickering"""" and """"bullshit"""". - V 
Veriverily's comments are misleading at best. """"All other parties,"""" according to Veriverily, are the users (Cadr, EdPoor, AstroNomer, and himself) voting in the minority in the most recent round of polling. His preferred version does not have a """"consensus"""" behind it. This was really the winning position in the poll: """"Yes, it should be asserted, in both the intro paragraph and the CIA role in coup section, and not marked as controversial.""""  
Consensus had been reached before 172 started trolling; the poll was started afterwards and brought in random buddies of 172.  The poll voters he cites consist mostly of users who had no role in editing or contributing to the page and visibly no understanding of the issues and were voting ideologically.  Even so, the margin was only 8-5, far from overpowering.  Furthermore, one does not vote on whether to be neutral. - V 

I wasn't  """"brought in"""" to vote. Nor was I voting """"ideologically"""", rather my vote was determined by my familiarity with the issues. Perhaps instead of attacking anyone who voted differently from him V V should present more compelling arguments  

Who am I attacking?  And saying I """"should present more compelling arguments"""" supports my supposition that you were not aware of the talk of these issues, because if so you would have seen the thousands and thousands of words arguing these very points. - V 

I wasn't  """"brought in"""" to vote, I wasn't voting """"ideologically"""" and I have made (minor) contributions to the article.
 

Regardless of who the poll may have """"brought in"""", I think part of the purpose of listing this page at Wikipedia:Requests for comment, where it has appeared quite regularly for a while, is to """"bring in"""" opinions from members of the community.

However, to maintain the paragraph format and avoid lists, I feel the material will need to be overhauled.  As it currently reads (which may well be the problem), some delineation felt necessary.

The 'gender gap' will never be closed unless Wikipedia becomes a place for women to gossip and socialize with each other on. The only 'cultural bias' Wikipedia has is that it is 'biased' towards objectively important subjects such as science, which coincidentally happen to be those pursued until recently by the Western society, which incidentally has always been the only culture around at all. The 'undue coverage of women' comes from the fact that there are less notable women. Insisting on 'equal coverage' of women and men will result in unequal proportion of notable and non-notable people. The policies supposed to make the place more accessible to women, such as ill-conceived politeness, will only result in making it less accessible to people who only care about getting the fucking job done. ~~~~"

Russell was active in the Fabian socialist movement.  His political thought was certainly very sympathetic to many technocratic ideas, but was generally more abstract than any ideology.  Roads to Freedom makes patent his political promiscuity: Russell was willing to support any movement that would tend to push history towards human freedom, humane social relations, and the rational satisfaction of human needs.  (Although when nuclear war was concerned, he seemed to prefer social injustice to complete ruin).  On the other hand, Russell was deeply skeptical of technology and science in its influence on human society and culture.  The Scientific Outlook was his vision of a scientific dystopia—one which incorporates much of technocracy.  (For the uninitiated: it is somewhat similar to Brave New World).  Although the technocratic elements are not necessarily portrayed in a negative light, they are not left blameless for the resulting society.  All in all, it seems hard to imagine that book could be the work of an enthusiastic technocrat. — 06:39, 27 January 2007"

 Carbon-Carbon 

Perhaps that could use a little more explanation, then. Carbon brakes  are carbon on carbon, in that the material is used as both brake pad and disc. However, the material used is a carbon-carbon composite: carbon fibres set in a carbon matrix (see Reinforced carbon-carbon for more technical stuff). It could actually be either reason I suppose, but they are normally referred to as 'carbon-carbon'. The topic is discussed in greater detail further down the article - I've put a '(see below)' at the first appearance of 'carbon-carbon' which links to the 'Technical innovation' section further down.

Thanks for all the further edits - I've only reverted one (sorry! -)). The direct quote from Michael Scarlett about the MRD/merde connection shouldn't be corrected (ellipsis is acceptable), even if wrong grammatically, since that's what he wrote.

One question - I don't understand why in """"He also became the first man to win a Formula One race in a car bearing his own name..."""" 'race' is now in italics. 'Race' as opposed to what?

Comment
I think it would be best for all involved to give Missionary/Retcon (I will use Retcon because it is the oldest of the accounts) a chance to redeem himself, and for all parties to terminate the inquisition against him.  Using a sockpuppet or changing to a different account to escape unwanted criticism is permitted at Wikipedia.  If his actions had been limited to that, I would not have responded to Tommstein's request at all as an ill-founded request.  However, what led me to respond were two factors: one, that Retcon had fraudulently attempted to mislead people into believing he and Missionary were different people, and two, that he created at least one impersonation account, impersonating a person who he was clearly at odds with.

In any case, Retcon has acknowledged and apologized for his inappropriate acts; Wikipedia's """"assume good faith"""" policy all but requires to accept his apology and move on.  So let's please do so.  I'd especially call on  and  to lay off the rhetoric; it will not help defuse the situation.  Personal attacks (such as  calling Retcon a """"compulsive liar"""") are neither helpful nor welcomed.  There is bad blood on both sides of this issue, and frankly I'd like to see y'all work this out on your own with civility, rather than escalating the situation to the point that intervention by the Arbitration Committee is required.

Dispute over Human Rights Watch citation

This edit is the latest in a minor fracas over this cite, which fracas began here when Wehwalt removed the cite from the lede, describing HRW as a """"pressure group."""" Actually, in this controversial topic, probably the majority of sources could be described as """"pressure groups,"""" but that doesn't make them reliable when properly cited. I restored the cite in a less prominent position here, at which point Wehwalt added a rebuttal sentence, with edit summary """"added explanation of why the IDF knocked down these structures, consolidated into the Background section."""" I found this problematic, because the article doesn't actually say what Wehwalt added; it says that the group analyzed the claims by the IDF, and found them to be largely bogus. So, to leave Wehwalt's edit in place creates a false impression of what the HRW reports. I modified the section according, which edit was then reverted by Wehwalt. I'm going to leave it alone for a day or so to give Wehwalt the opportunity to clean it up. Incidentally, in Wehwalt's latest edit summary, he says that """"This is the article on Corrie, not on home demolitions. We are to give the reader a modicum of info on this, not draw conclusions."""" First of all, it seems to me that Corrie is only notable because of home demolitions. Secondly, giving the reader """"a modicum of info"""" would be best served by an accurate summary of the HRW cite, whereas altering it for POV reasons would be an example of """"drawing conclusions.""""

However, at the moment, not enough time has passed to assess whether Sudan will become commonly known as North Sudan; As editors have mentioned - more likely than not it won't become known by that term. It would be wrong this single ONE (of several) colloquial term for the Sudan and include it in the very first sentence. Finally, you referred to my contributions on the question of the name of South Sudan...That is a topic for the other page...but suffice to say, it was not a question of me not liking anything; it was a question of what the Constitution of that country says (Art. 1) 84.203.69.183  """

Not being used to Wiki process I didn't see the warning until after it was made although I'm not sure what that difference would have made long term. The notion of fascism in respect of the operation of wiki is not meant as an insult but describes a particular way of operating a nation, organisation etc. Having spent many years dealing with institutional abuse of authority etc. the """"harassment"""" of my contribution was corporate, but for those very reasons it will not be a productive line of enquiry. I suppose I could also turn to a zealous enforcement of the rules and seek wiki awards. 
Anyway in respect of my request we're now leaving wiki territory in terms of copyright and going where statutory law applies. Can you point me in the direction of an administrator or agent of wiki that can deal with this issue knowledgeabley? I haven't assigned copyright to wiki and wiki policy can't supersede law. I suppose I could formally assign copyright of all those images to a third party which would immediately create a wiki violation.
I'd also be interested in views about the difference between self-interest in requiring attribution and that notion in respect of links. It's a mark (and again this is a valid view) of paternalistic and authoritarian operations no matter how benign to operate arbitrarily without explanation. I'm asking this because there is a prima facia contradiction in application of the stated rules, although I'm not expecting this to receive an effective explanation this time any more than last.

One question: in the comparison of UKIP's performance to that of other parties, I think saying that the SNP polled less than UKIP could be misleading for non-UK readers. If I didn't know that the SNP only stood candidates in Scotland, I'd get the impression from the current text that UKIP did much better than the SNP on average. But knowing that UKIP put up candidates across the country (while the SNP didn't) gives quite a different impression, since, of course, the SNP polled much better than UKIP everywhere it put up candidates. So for the benefit of non-UK readers, in the section comparing UKIP's performance to that of the Lib Dems and SNP, perhaps it might be helpful to add """"ahead of the Scottish National Party (who only contested seats in Scotland)""""?

I won't make that addition unless you approve, though.

Oh, one more thing - do we have a quote from a UKIP official or UKIP press release on the official reaction to the election result, or a link to an article about it?

That was a mistake. A momentary lapse of reason. I'd somehow got it into my head that somehow, someway, just the slightest degree of sensibility would kick in. I'd forgotten that logic has no place here.

Clio basically told Dirk he doesn't know shit, and so I basically parrotted that back to her in order to try to point out to you guys once again for the zillionth time that you're letting her get away with murder.

And then came the ugliness. I'd forgotten about the whole thing until just now when I noticed in my contributions that I'd apparently made a remark on her page. Talk about a personal attack. I swear I've rarely seen such sickening thoughts put into words. And all about me. Such anger, such twisted hatred, such disturbed imagery...

No. I don't care how irritating this whole thing is. It's not worth it. This girl is not well, and NEITHER of us are helping. Haven't you noticed how many regulars have simply stopped editing out of frustration? Haven't you noticed how pretty much every question is answered by the same person? Do you not realize how responsibile you are for having actively participated in the transformation of the Humanities RefDesk from once being a vibrant place where one could find a multifaceted, multidimensional answer written by a variety of differing editors, each with his own invaluable unique insights and perspectives, into the stale, single-faceted unidimensional, useless place it is now?

No. It's not worth it. It's futile. Worse actually. Perhaps I share in some of the blame myself. If it wasn't for my relentless protestations, perhaps the whole thing would have blown over, Clio would have gotten bored of the Humanities RefDesk, moved on, and it wouldn't be the cold, sterile place it is now.

Perhaps I lost perspective, and didn't realize the magnitude of the harm that my persistent challenges could potentially inflict on a very fragile and terribly imbalanced young mind.

Just please read the damn thing over, Rockpocket. Here it is:  . Those rants of hers are clearly not the product of a healthy mind. I recognize that now. I have to stop. What I'm doing is wrong. So to all who will inevitably read this, I say publicly to Clio:

You win. I lose. You're right. I'm wrong. You're smart and you were right all along, I'm an intellectually impoverished imbecile. Yes, as you say, I'm pathetic.

Notes for the blind communist Castro lovers editing wikipedia and for the man himself

There seems to be a group of people around here in wikipedia with very strong leftist tendency that are very blind as to no recognize Castro for what he is. But not to worry. History will take care of him like it took care of Hitler and Stalin and other horrible dictators the people in the world have suffer.
There is a lot of talk in wikipedia about having a neutral POV but there is no such thing here. All the Castro's agents and lovers are here polishing his image probably getting paid with free vacations by the dictator at Varadero beach in Cuba while many true Cuban heroes die in prison just for opposing Castro and what he represents. A decadent regime, a waste of time for the Cuban people. 
Castro I know you or your agents will read this. So do not worry. History will take care of you and be assure that you will not look this good as it appear here. 
You could have been great a great leader if you had help Cuba get out of a dictator like Batista and then surrender power to the people to democracy! 
But you want to know something. You became worst than Batista the moment you started killing many innocent people just at the beginning of the revolution. You yourself killed the revolution with all the blood and with your unlimited greed for power. 
You claim Cuba is the most democratic country in the world. 

""""Right""""!How many people prefer to die on the tooth of a shark better than at your hands? How many desperate people abandon the  island? Because there is no other choice? or maybe because they are anyway dying an slow death at the hands of your regime, controlling every little bit of information as you an your agents are doing here at wikipedia. Cleaning up your image! 
It amazes me. Because this goes to show what you are. A megalomaniac! too worry about what history will tell about you, about what your legacy will be.
Do not worry Fidel Castro. I will let you know this. Do not even let yourself think for a second that you are at the same level as Jose Marti, Feliz Varela or even a Simon Bolivar. 
You do not get even up one inch in front of them in fact I can tell you that you go down for miles and miles.  
You must be full of envy about Chavez! because his got the oil money you never had! and because of it he can buy some people. But do not be! Some people are not for sale. Some people will not buy the lies you sell.
This is for you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, and who fantasize about Castro and Che I will also be sorry to disappoint you by telling you that you Castro that you are not  even at Che's level, yes the same one you made a martyr, an icon of the revolution, Your first patron saint. The same one you sell in t-shirts and postcards now and you profit from! 
That is because at least Che had principles, something you really do not know what it is or even fathom, 
he(Che) probably believe in communism and that it was a good thing because of his youth, while on the other hand you Castro  just used it for your own personal benefit and profit.

Ask yourself why Che die? why Camilo Cienfuegos die? and many others close to power in Cuba?

Many people said that Castro himself send someone to kill him! He just can not stand someone close to power(because he is very afraid to loose it he is paranoid about it,obsess with power , anybody close to him have to be very careful no to upset him or to contradict any of his ideas even the bad ones. Poor guys, I am sorry for them. 
 
Castro have subjugated and dominated the Cuban people who have suffer for years without end his power and very long rants. But no more.. Just like everything that is born some day you too Fidel Castro will also die sooner or later. Do not worry, when you die we the Cubans enjoying freedom will not celebrate your death but will rejoice about the change that will happen to our homeland after you will be gone. Sorry to see all the time wasted but not to worry. Cuba will be rebuild. All the Cuban blood you have spilled in and out of the country will not be in vane. You know why that will be? Because, Cubans will have learn their lesson. 

For you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, believe me if you impartially read all the news about Fidel Castro and check all his speeches from the very beginning of the revolution you can see his evolution. How power have corrupted him and his regime. How many innocent people have been kill in the name of the revolution? how much intolerance! how many times he has sell out his """"principles"""". 
Just to refresh old memories Cuba was suppose to be for Cubans at the beginning of the revolution. For a while Now because the commander was afraid of loosing his grip on power he had to"

As to why he hasn't responded further, that is quite obvious: he already explained to you his reasoning.

You are continuing to misrepresent my original objection.  My objection was NOT that 'he didn't respond in 8 hours', or anything like that.  (You portrayed that as my objection, though!).  Instead, I objected that Dodo wasn't addressing MY ACTUAL OBJECTIONS.  Other than his 'driveby deletions', and a template or two, he DIDN'T respond to my complaints.  Not only  did he not address my objections within a day (as you implied my original complaint was), he didn't even EVENTUALLY address my objections!  Irresponsibly, and probably maliciously, you tried to make me look like 'the bad guy' for objecting to Dodo's repeated rapid deletions without waiting for consensus, etc.
Dodo was trying to act on the theory, 'if somebody does ANYTHING even arguably criticizable, I can slap him down repeatedly by deleting his edits, without waiting for any sort of consensus, etc.'  (Evidently, that is your position as well.)  I say, """"No!"""".  Dodo never, in detail, responded to my repeated and DETAILED complaints of his behavior.  Is the reason that 'he is busy'?  Well, if he's SO BUSY, 
why did he have enough time to repeatedly delete my posts?  Doesn't make sense, does it?  The answer is quite simple:  Dodo (and, I suspect, many other self-appointed 'Info-Nazi's' ALWAYS have time to slap down other users (that's EASY, and takes little time!), but they DON'T have enough time to actually defend their own actions when challenged!  Dodo (and many others) amount to semi-professional BUSYBODIES who strut their stuff by interfering with others' use of WP.  Stop it.

4503,"Hi Eric, no. You are not in any way one of the people I was talking about. You just got caught in the crossfire, and if I made you think I was thinking of you I apologise. Your work is consistent good plus even more importantly, you have a sensitivity to other people's work with a few people don't. You build on their work to produce something that improves in quality. The people I was talking about arrive at an article, chop it around, change meanings, change context, spelling, capitalisation and then move on, more often than not without giving the slightest suggestion that they actually knew what they were doing. 

For example, one guy when he comes across the word taoisigh which is the gaelic plural for taoiseach and which is explained as such on its first mention in some articles, frequently changes it to taoiseachs, a non-existent word. He has tried to change governors-general to governor-generals, Prime Minister to Prime minister. He changed links from President of Ireland to President of Ireland, links to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (ie the form of UK between 1901 and 1922) to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, so linking the reference to the wrong UK. He mucked up some links to Tánaiste (deputy Irish prime minister) by lower-casing it, changed a series of mentions of First Lady when referring to a specific first lady to lowercase first lady, changed one mention of Garret FitzGerald to Garrett Fitzgerald, removed the word Óg from Gearóid Og Fitzgerald and Mór from Gearóid Mór Fitzgerald, not grasping that they actually were two different people (Mór = big in gaelic and indicated the father, Óg meaning small meant his son) and ended up turning an article that mentioned them both into gobbledigook. That is just some of my work he has mucked up. He made a complete mess of some biology articles, reduced an article on mediæval history to such a degree of unreadability that the author, one of the world's top mediæval historians, quick wiki in disgust. I know at least six people who have left wiki over his actions. And there are quite a few such people. Not a lot, but enough to mangle everything they touch. Another contributor constantly changed an elementary fact in 18th century history on the basis of google searches. I checked on google. The majority of articles said he was right. Those google searches turned up stuff that were barely of high school standard. But she treated google as sacrosanct. If a google search said it, it was gospel. 

I have had political science articles which I have written and which were based on hard fact, in mediocre garbage, applying wrong capitalisation (again based on google searches that largely threw up high school essays), wrong spelling, wrong interpretation, etc. I wasn't reacting simply to the Droop Quota at all (that was the sixth article that day I had done that had been 'hit'. In that case Michael Hardy as he is prone to do, swept in to a topic he knows little about, changed capitalisation, text and even the formula which is the standard DQ formula taught (in that form because as already happened in the discussion on the talk page, if you leave out the parentheses people muck up the order of the calculation and so get the wrong formula). That intervention was classic Michael; go onto a page about a topic he doesn't know much about and instead of asking why it is written like that, unilaterally change it, in most cases producing a version that is so wrong it would be savaged if any student repeated it in a class.

American english and British English use different approaches to capitalisation. Many of the references were to things only found outside the US and so capitalised. Instead he insisted on applying US capitalisation rules to things whose capitalisation is a result of their existence and usage in parts of the world outside the US. That indeed is one of the reasons why google should never be used in checking capitalisation. Apart from its general unreliability, most website mentions in the US are created by people who automatically and incorrectly apply US capitalisation to things that don't exist in the US and are capitalised internationally. A classic example is the electoral system PR.STV (Proportional Representation using the Single Transferable Vote). Michael insisted on lowercasing it on the basis on a google search. PR.STV isn't used in the US and is generally capitalised when referring to the specific voting system, and lowercased when used generically. Where it is mentioned on google, it is largely on the basis of Americans writing about it and downcasing it to suit American english. So Michael unilaterally mucked up the capitalisation, then another US user moved the page to another name that refers to a somewhat similar but not the same electoral system more widely known in the US. So any non-American user would get r"

 False inormation in the article 
As you would expect, the propagandists would say and do everything to mislead us. They once again proved themselfs to be the proven LIARS we alreayd knew they were since the article wrongly states that the darker picture with the """"fall-off"""" effects is the edited one, which is pure BS.

The original photo is the one with the """"fall-off"""" effect which was printed in The West Australian already back in august 2, 1969 (~6 min in this clip http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMuTiziCszU) while the lighten up picture is the EDITED version who came out much later. So unless the propaganda trolls cant find a version of THEIR claimed original version dated EARLIER than august second 1969, i suggest them to SHUTUP.

 The Buzz Alrdin photo is explained at Examination_of_Apollo_Moon_photographs#Issues with crosshairs in photos.   You talkin' to me? 

The video shows a guy holding up the actual newspaper from 2 aug 1969 to prove that the """"fall-off"""" picture is how the original one looked like, but then its youtube who isnt a reliable source!?  your desperate try for making a point is laughable... but i wouldnt expect more from a propaganda TROLL.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 91.145.38.53   

 No, that newspaper doesn't show what the original one looks like.  The original is a transparency that is in NASA's vaults.  They made prints that were widely reprinted. See this for more information.  You talkin' to me? 

Bullshit! excuses from NASA wont make it true! you have the history of that picture in the video i linked to and even the NASA site you linked to shows the fact that the darker picture is the first one, the original from 1969, while the more lighten edited version came out 1975. So why you arguing? you dont have a chance here. As i said, BRING UP a picture dated earlier than 2 aug 1969 or SHUTUP - its that simple!

I don't mess with chumps, for those to been to jail
That's the cat with the Kool-Aid on his lips and pumps
I can't deal with brother that think they broads
Only know how to be one way, that's the dog
I know how to get down, know how to bite, bite
Bark very little, but I know how to fight, fight
I know how to chase a cat up in the tree

Once a song, I come though, guns is drawn
BLAM BLAM, lungs are gone, sons will mourn
From dusk till dawn, nighttime belongs to the dog
On the street passed midnight, look for 'em in the morgue
Don't play with these cats cuz I ain't got nothin to say to these cats
For the mothers that really do love em, please pray for these cats
Cuz I know they all is hardheaded but I ain't got the patience
Don't want me havin no patience turn into more patience
More trips to I.C.U cuz I see you
Tryna get away with things a real wouldn't do
Where my dogs at? (right here) See them niggaz? (right there)
get em boy! (right there) That's how we do... (aiight then)
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs

27927,"A True Story

Once upon a time, there was this guy who'd edited Wikipedia anonybously for many months (let's call him Derek). Derek edited anonymously so regularly hopped from IP address to IP address. He was very happy making contributions to what he believed to be a reputable encyclopedia. He worked as a journalist at a London based newspaper in the real world, and in the virtual world, Wikipedia was one of his many hobbies, where he edited this and that and made a small difference - so he liked to think. But then Derek made a huge mistake - when he tried to take on the cyber bullies - and  and came off the worse for it.

It was the afternoon of [[Monday[[ 7 April 2008. Derek had the day off work and was online and browsing Wikipedia. He happened to click on an article about the Radio 2 traffic presenter Sally Bowsman via the random articles button, and he noticed a piece of vandalism. Derek reverted it.

Derek's next move was to look at who had added this piece of vandalism. He knew it was against Wikipedia rules to vandalise pages, so issued a user warning to the chap involved in the vandalism. Derek then decided he would keep an eye on this individual so that he might revert any more vandalism that  might commit.

And lo and behond,  did exactly that. Derek reverted more vandalism and issued further warnings. Even when  made a personal attack against Derek, accusing him of having a personal interest in these other articles, Derek issued the appropriate warning.

Things eventually got to the point where  had used up his four lives - that is, he had been issued with four user warnings; and still  continued to make disruptive edits. Derek therefore decided to approach WP:AIV and report this. Derek then looked at Tom's page history and discovered that he was a regular disruptive editor with rogue edits stretching back over a year.

A user by the name of  promptly blocked the user. But two hours later, he had what can only be described as an attack of conscience and he unblocked .  didn't really give a reason for this about face other than that he had made a mistake. There then followed some discussion between Derek and Todd, and  even threw in his two penneth. Todd suggested Derek and Tom should chill out. Derek thought that a jolly good idea, and Derek even posted a friendly message on Tom's talk page urging him to make sensible edits - after all, unconstructive edits damage the reputation of Wikipedia, and the thing which damanges Wiki's reputation further is when rogue editors are allowed to continue making rogue edits willy nilly.

Tom began editing again, and he was soon being his old disruptive self. Derek reverted the edit, then decided to go back to WP:AIV and report this new offence. Unfortunately though, this is where he came unstuck.

 soon accused Derek of Wikistalking and promptly decided that  and so he deleted Derek's report - he didn't even have the decency to leave it for another admininstrator to assess the situation.

So Derek came away with a blooded nose for his troubles, and Derek feels he has no choice now than to leave Wikipedia. He posted the following message on Toddy's talk page:

    Unfortunately, your decision is a bad day for common sense. By reversing his block you have given him the green light to do as he wishes. Furthermore, you have also now made a personal attack against me. I was trying to help clear up what I saw - when I checked his edit history this afternoon - to be a long-standing problem which nobody appears to be willing to address. It seems whenever one tries to stand up to the bullies, one comes away with a bloody nose for one's troubles. Well, on your heads be it. It's unsurprising that Wikipedia is seen as such an unreliable source in the press when people such as this are given carte blanche to do what they want (I am a journalist so ought to know"

The authors discuss the lack of reliable data on the number of ASL users and the widely disparate estimations made on the web (100,000 to 15,000,000). They conclude that no reliable estimate of the number of signers exists, and that most estimates can be traced to two unreliable studies in the 1970s. This wikipedia article, when it was accessed by the author (November 9, 2004), suggested that ASL ranked somewhere between 3rd-most and 10th-most used language in the USA.

Ah...I see you're refusing to reply! I once read a story about someone who refused to do things, except in this case it was about someone who refused to listen to instructions and advice. It was set in a small village being terrorised (and when I say """"terrorised"""", I make no reference to terrorism) by a Big Bad Wolf (not, of course, referring to the Doctor Who Bad Wolf, but to the Big bad Wolf in the article linked to).

Anyway, this boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice decided to scare everyone, so he told them that the wolf was coming to eat them. They all believed him, and started running around like headless chickens (and it being a farming village, quite possible the chickens would have run around like headless chickens too, only they wouldn't have been headless at that point, probably). Anyway, they eventually found out that there was no wolf coming to eat them, and got very cross with the boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice. They told the boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice never to tell lies like that again.

The next day, this boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice decided to scare everyone, so he told them that the wolf was coming to eat them. They all believed him, and started running around like headless chickens (and it being a farming village, quite possible the chickens would have run around like headless chickens too, only they wouldn't have been headless at that point, probably). Anyway, they eventually found out that there was no wolf coming to eat them, and got very cross with the boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice. They told the boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice never to tell lies like that again.

And the next day, the Big Bad Wolf really did come, and the first person it found was the boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice. And the boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice shouted for help, and everyone ignored him, because they thought that the boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice was simply trying to scare them by saying that the Big Bad Wolf was hungry again. And so the Big Bad Wolf ate the boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice, and lived happily ever after.

Actually, when I say that I read the story, actually I must confess that I was told it when I was at Fifestead Grammar School, because what happened was that I set the fire alarm off, and everyone panicked, and thought that there was a fire. And the headmaster took me into his office and told me this story. Anyway, do you see the connection with yourself ignoring my messages and the boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice?

 I'd be happy to work on the lead (or for anyone else to have a go at it), and any suggestions for improvement are always welcome, but it seems absurd for an FA not to have an FA class rating from a related project.  Basically, you're saying your standards are different from community consensus as determined through the FAC (and, in this case, FAR) processes. The two ratings in the mathematics project's grading scheme that are not subjective are FA and GA.  In this case, rather than attempt to unilaterally downgrade the article I think a better approach might have been to raise the issues you see on the talk page (or simply fix them).  In the future if you're hesitant to """"sign"""" an FA or GA rating, then perhaps you should add the rating but not sign it.  Of course, if the mathematics project wants to have its own """"FA"""" sort of rating, that's fine, but then it shouldn't be called FA and shouldn't link to WP:FA. 

On a perhaps related note, I don't know how many participants from the mathematics project actively watch Monty Hall problem.  It is a fairly difficult article to maintain since it has both the same sort of problem as 0.999... (i.e. many people simply disagree with the mathematically correct conclusion) and the additional problem of being a simple enough problem that everyone has an opinion.

Since it was an edit to the first line, I don't think it would be appropriate to add more to that part of the article, as the logic behind the article is already within the rest of the article (record sales, changes. etc.) and it would look strange to discuss record sales and etc in the first line of the article, right?

I say """"personal attacks"""" as his behaviour towards me in not appropriate. It is harassment, since I actually messaged him politely about the change i made (which I am not even supposed to do, since wikipedia is not his property) and if he found a problem, he could have likewise messaged me back instead of running to an editor with yet another complaint about me. I made such a minor edit to the article, and if there was any mistake, could he not have merely pointed out any errors to me as a newbie instead? Or does he have a problem with allowing newcomers to work on wikipedia as well and merely try to land them in trouble instead? I am not really sure why he is determined to complain about me no matter what edit I make, but his aggressive stance is clear, and if everyone were to behave this way towards newbies, I am sure wikipedia would become a very isolated place, which it is indeed not. I am open to anyone explaining how I can imp[rove my edits, but I am not open to being treated like a criminal - by this exact same one user - for every word I ever type on the site. Please note that my edits were made in good faith and that I have written nothing malicious.

 Back to the facts: conquest/annexed into so-called """"Serbia"""" 

Why has everyone got a problem with a damn good well written neutral source from a neutral country (UK) free to edit newspaper??? Kosova was conquered, right? It was 75% Albanian, right? It was never legally drafted into Serbia, we know because if there was a real """"treaty in London"""" then Noel Maclom would have added it to his """"Is Kosova Serbia?"""" article. I prefer to use the term """"annexed"""" because it was a completely illegal incorporation into the territory. And as Malcolm said (if you read the source), after 1918, it went back to being a self-governing (by it's Albanians) land within a """"Yugoslavia"""" NOT part of Serbia. I believe Serbia's first ever involvement with Kosova after 1912 was when in 1989 Milosevic made his famous """"Greater Serbia"""" speech in Kosova, started to move Serbs into the county and then send his Serb troops to invade the land and expand Serbia's territory, followed by the ethnic cleansing of Albanians/non-Serbs, and genocide of the rest.

Re Talk:Dinosaur """"Another error""""
I'd respond to your query instantly except that I'm not going to make life easier for those (not you) who have twice reverted my edits to Dinosaur - if it were not for the reverts I'd have quietly corrected the item. But I've noticed your much more friendly and co-operative tone in our few discussions and the many well-earned congratulations in your Talk page, and I'll be very happy to co-operate with you on any other article if it is appropriate.   

Re Physiology of dinosaurs I'd be happy to contribute. I think I already suggested that the warmblooded/coldblooded debate should be a separate article - in fact Physiology of dinosaurs started life as """"Warmbloodedness of dinosaurs"""" and I was fairly happy that it was coherent and well-structured after my last edit under that title (although of course there was room for improvements). Physiology of dinosaurs looks the kind of article that will spawn further """"more details"""" articles as we find more material.

Re your suggestion of a """"Dinosaur behavior"""" article, I agree the relevant section of Dinosaur is getting too long. But I suspect (totally off the top of my head) that there's too much variation for one article when you consider differences in: time (150M years); size; lifestyle (predator / scavenger / browser / grazer); environment; and specific clades (although clade may not be a helpful grouping, look at lions and tigers). My inclination (off the top again) would be to handle this aspect bottom up, e.g. """"behaviour of dromaesosaurs"""", """"behaviour of large tyrannosaurids"""", """"behaviour of Jurassic sauropods"""", """"behaviour of large late Cretaceous ceratopsians"""" (bound to be different from that of smaller, earlier ones because the big, late ones had horns). Even working out how to structure a set of articles on this topic probably needs input from people with knowledge of specific groups / periods. But I'm game for it, as I think structuring a large set of related articles is a current weakness in Wikipedia (I'm involved in an attempt to remedy that in 1 subject area, History of IBM mainframe operating systems, see the Talk page). 

Re the conflicts, see User talk:Philcha#Dinosaur (period concerned is Jan - Mar 2007) and Talk:Dinosaur#Corrections_urgently_needed (21 Nov 2007). That's twice I've corrected errors in the article and had my edits reverted. In the earlier instance I pointed out the errors on Talk:Dinosaur and other defects and balance issues in Oct 2007 and nothing happened for 3 months. So I edited in Jan 2007 and my edit was reverted almost instantly. My current impression is that a certain clique thinks it owns that article and would rather revert edits not controlled by them than see the article improved by someone who's not a member of the clique and / or who (in the earlier instance) interprets Wikipedia guidelines differently from them. The more I look round Wikipedia the more places I can see where I can contribute, so I don't have time play games with such people.  ([["

23846,"""==Questionable punishment of D*98==
The January 2010 block against User:Darryl98 was extremely harsh, IMHO, as being a 1-month block for a WP:3RR violation that was escalated by a more-experienced user who was well aware of goading people into a revert-war. Perhaps an 8-day block would have been more fair, with an attempt to discuss the situation during those 8 days, and possibly remove the block sooner than 8 days, after true consensus (that means a mutual agreement). Please understand that Wikipedia policies are actually much more fair, in writing, than the way some users (and admin users) misapply those policies: the typical block for WP:3RR is only a 24-hour block, not 1 month. In fact, per WP:Blocking_policy, use of excessive blocking is a violation due to the reasoning that new users will become highly irritated by excessive punishment. The idea of fair punishment isn't just a matter of human decency, or common sense when trying to actually """"collaborate"""" with other users, no, much more than those reasons, fair punishment is a stated policy issue. I think what needs to be added, to avoid excessive punishment, is to develop a type of """"Code of Hammurabi"""" as a list of wiki-punishments for each situation, based on length of tenure, total edit-count, and repeat-offenses, so that the punishment does NOT just become a matter of """"lengthen the block so a user won't come back soon to cause more trouble"""". Meanwhile, rather than reducing future conflicts, excessive punishment poisons the Internet community with unhappy users who spread the word of how they were mistreated. Typically, users will not see unfairness as a few admins crossing the line and violating policies in a harsh manner, instead, a user victim is likely to """"blame Wikipedia"""" for being a """"bad system"""" that harrasses and abuses people. What needs to be emphasized, in discussions during a shorter block, is that some (many?) users (admins) violate policies, but this is not condoned, it's just hard to enforce because a banned user can return using a social-networking site that has thousands of IP addresses and Wikipedia cannot easily stop them. Also, Wikipedia has very limited appeal processes, and so there is nothing, yet, as sophisticated as even the """"American notion of justice"""" in Wikipedia: there are no trials by jury of informed peers (chosen at random). Instead, many issues are decided by """"dog pile"""" groups, who collect around a common bias or mindset, as a sort of """"feeding frenzy"""" or hive mind that sees a negative remark as a veiled attack against the hive, and many members of the hive must sink into """"sting mode"""" to counter-attack a person who states angry remarks. Currently, Wikipedia likes people who are ultra-mild and don't claim any Bill of Rights but simply beg to belong with the others. Hence, people from democratic republics come to Wikipedia and might demand their rights under the law, without realizing it is the Law of the Old West: be as nice as possible to avoid getting shot by other users/admins who are toting wiki-guns. Only some people think users have any rights to fair treatment, despite current WP policies that even require actions to be fair within those regulations. Perhaps WP needs to teach """"fairness classes"""" to users who come from fascist countries or domineering parents: being fair and courteous is not a strong force of nature, but rather must be taught to users. - 
Wikid, I'm sure that you are well aware of why WP cannot tolerate the improper use of WP:Sockpuppets. Just as your socking as Wz777 had to be stopped, so did PilgrimRose's socking as Darryl98. But blocks are not regarded as punishment, they are regarded as protection of WP from those who, like yourself, are having difficulty working within the rules. The indef block of a sockpuppet is applied equally to all such.  come howl 
 If you read that user's larger prior talk-page revisions, you will see that the stated preference was to become named as """"Darryl98"""" so I am respecting that request. In changing names, that user was not aware of how people can be goaded into a WP:3RR excess of revisions, and that escalation seemed to be the most serious of the policy violations. It is not a violation to have multiple usernames on Wikipedia. Plus, as an occasional user, it seemed that Darryl98 had spent extensive time to read the policies about WP:Sockpuppetry and properly explained each issue as it applied in the situation: no clear violation of puppets, but rather just being accused of """"nefarious"""" intentions, which was noted as a violation of WP:AGF. Again, the largest disturbance was engaging in a WP:3RR violation, typically risking a 24-hour block, wh"

Fair use rationale for Image:Obamagirlvideo.JPG

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Obamagirlvideo.JPG. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any non-free media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

In Turkey, according to a survey in early October 2009, 53 percent of the population would object to having a Jewish neighbor. He has been accused of exploiting such prejudice for political gains: On October 8, 2009, he stated in a speech at the Yildiz Technical University of Istanbul that he has been watching """"the Jewish model of success"""", pointing to """"their [the Jews'] buisness instinct"""", and claiming that """"Jews are able to make their money multilply while seated.""""En Turquie, le premier ministre, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, exploite un sentiment d'hostilité vis-à-vis d'Israël (Le Monde, October 19, 2009)

Reviewing your sources.... """"MSM in Africa"""" does not contain the string """"trans"""" anywhere in the document.  I don't know what you expect in that document being used as a reference, except to increase your refcount.  UNAIDS states that """"TG is typically considered alongside"""".  It is fairly equivocal about the whole matter.  The Powerpoint Document gives the most convincing argument with the statement: """"With regard to HIV surveillance and prevention, the CDC’s current practice is not to separate MTF TG and TS people from the MSM category, with no attention paid to the risks of FTM TG people."""" (A noted lack of source on this in the document is noted here... it amounts to hearsay.)  The MSTGW article speaks against applying labels such as """"MSM"""" and categorizing people.  This would include the MSM label.  That the article specifically refers to these individuals as """"MSTGW"""" and not """"MSM"""" is a good indicator that TG individuals would be non-MSM.  Lastly the HIV-releated Tuberculosis document specifically states that the individuals are male and that: """"Some network members dressed as women and participated in dance and fashion competitions known as """"balls."""" These social networks include """"houses"""" (i.e., a guild providing a social framework for young MSM and transgender persons) that exist in many large U.S. cities (house leader, personal communication, 2000).

My conclusion... I have to admit, I've been viewing TG too narrowly, and excluding individuals that are TG, yet also MSM.  However, that doesn't mean that TS individuals are MSM... it's hard to argue that a drag queen isn't MSM, while it is hard to argue that a post-operative MTF living a life in stealth is an MSM.

Plagiarism?

This source, which is from Medieval Italy: an Encyclopedia,""""  ed. Christopher Kleinhenz, has been plagiarized, or nearly so, in a version of this article. Take this old version of the article as a reference point, and compare the following (emphasis added by me):

Dionigi di Borgo San Sepolcro (born circa 1300, died 1342) was from Sansepolcro near Arezzo. (Wikipedia)
Dionigi (c. 1300–1342) was born in Sansepolcro, near Arezzo. (Medieval Italy)

He was an Augustinian scholar of very keen intellect and was much sympathetic towards others. (Wikipedia)
He entered the Augustinian order at a young age and immediately distinguished himself by his keen intellect and piety. (Medieval Italy)

Dionigi was a scholar trained as an astrologer in Sorbonne as well as a theologian. He received his doctorate circa 1324. (Wikipedia)
He studied theology at the Sorbonne in Paris and received his doctorate c. 1324. (Medieval Italy)

One of Dionigi's works (which since has been lost) is his commentary (circa 1339–1342) on Valerius Maximus’s Factorum et dictorum memorabilium libri. (Wikipedia)
Almost all of Dionigi’s own writing has been lost. His most
famous work is his commentary (probably c. 1339–1342) on
Valerius Maximus’s Factorum et dictorum memorabilium libri. (Medieval Italy)

It became a template for subsequent commentaries on Valerius Maximus and also for several of Boccaccio’s reference works such as Esposizioni and Genealogia deorum gentilium.  (Wikipedia)
This commentary, with its many citations of classical authors, became a template not only for subsequent commentaries on
Valerius Maximus but also for several of Boccaccio’s nonfictional works, such as Esposizioni and Genealogia deorum gentilium. (Medieval Italy)

Another of Dionigi’s writings is a commentary on the first book of the Sententiae (a treatise on logic) and still another is a commentary on the pseudo Aristotelian Oeconomia'. (Wikipedia)
 Dionigi’s other writings include a commentary on the first book of the Sententiae, a treatise on logic, and a commentary on the pseudo-Aristotelian Oeconomia. (Medieval Italy'')

And that's just the first two paragraphs of that version of the WP article. In my opinion, this is a clear-cut case of plagiarism and a violation of copyright. Some of this remains in the article, some has been altered; but there's obviously a larger concern of whether there are other instances of plagiarism in the article. I'm not sure how to proceed.

As an artist and art historian, I am firm in the belief that the artist ought to be acknowledged.  Copyright protects the ownership of living artists and the more recently deceased. Decency ought to respect the ownership of earlier artists, and those who are still living but have permitted use of their work.  
I don't have any difficult about using without acknowledgment the very average point-and-click snapshots that get uploaded without being cropped or straightened.  But when Wikipedia has photos uploaded that are carefully composed and are """"artworks"""" in their own right, then the author needs acknowledgment.  It is probably wrong of me to make a distinction here, but there appears to be a difference between the camera holder functioning simply as a recorder and functioning as a thinking, planning creative artist. (Strangely enough, it is often the takers of badly lit lop-sided holidays snaps that want to be acknowledged.) 
It is, I suppose, a value judgement that I may not be entitled to make.  However, some of the world's top photographers have chosen to upload their works to Wikipedia. I would no more use a portrait by Allen Warren without stating the author than I would use a portrait by Van Dyck or Gainsborough. 
Tell me, we know when copyright drops out, but at what point, do you think, the right of acknowledgment of creative effort and real talent should cease?

In putting the term 'far right' before 'National Front', and removing the uncited last line that appears to promote Griffin (""""Since he became the leader of the BNP several educational institutions have invited him to speak on political radicalism, multiculturalism, and BNP policy."""")

Wikipedia describes the NF as """"a far right and whites-only party"""" in its main article - and this fact was as true when Griffin was a member of it as it is now. I also gave the clear reasons for removing the promotionally-phrased last line - so I'm not a vandal.

Having maintained that the National Front is indeed 'far right', can anyone really claim that adding this fact to this article is unhelpful or irrelevant? The current introducton gives very little real flavour of Nick Griffin (and his obvious 'notoriety' is left out completely), which compared to other Wikipedia articles on politicians is pretty scandalous in my eyes.

It is seems that as in America, Armenian and Greek lobbying is alive and well here, too. What a shame that Jews, who found solace in the Turkish Ottoman Empire, while the rest of Europe was have progrom festivals have come on board, too. It seems that all that it needs to get the Jew and the gentile on the same wagon, is to beat the tired old donkey issue of the barbarious Turk. 

It wears thin.

 Singer List? 

Hi. I have an idea that would allow people to view various prospects for Scott Weilands replacement in an easier way rather than just posting sentences in the """"Split from Weiland"""" section... How about someone ends the """"Split..."""" section with a closing paragraph about Scott leaving and then they form a new section titled something like: """"Rumored replacement singers"""" or something like that. And that section can have an opening statement saying """"Numerous individuals have been considered for scott weilands replacement; they include:"""" and then below, write a list of every person who has been rumored.
It is easier to find names rather than searching through a section of the article that doesnt even have a title relevant to the fact that VR is looking for a new singer...

 baiting Paul 

I don't think its entirely fair the way you are searching about for paul to call you a name, in order to use it against him. He is clearly uncertain of what label to give you, and any lable he did use is apt to be offensive (""""jew"""", """"commie"""" """"wanker"""", etc.. ;). IMO paul is a salvagable nutter, who is a resource to the wikipedia on the pages where he makes his 'home'. Yes, he is unpleasent, but wiki-punishments for wiki-crimes only work on sane wiki's, who don't have aol. Paul appears to have aol, and besides, crazy wikis can use http://anonymization.net/ or whatever to inflict us with their wackiness. Paul has shown me that he is able to compromise, and is at least vaguely interested in producing a quality article. This combined with his extensive hate group wisdom tells me that he should be worked with, or around, but never provoked.

Sorry, Dennis, but this doesn't convince me. You're saying that a Wikipedia visitor can """"check facts"""" for themselves by checking the sources, but this simply presupposes that the source is correct. It sounds like you're telling me that if I write an article referencing the Sump website, then that's just my opinion and it's unverifiable. But if someone else writes an article referencing the Sump website, then that IS verifiable, and that makes it okay. Well that sounds daft to me. It makes more sense to examine the preponderance of evidence and listen to counter arguments, albeit in the form of links). I simply don't accept the assertion that just because something is published, it's reliable, and if it's not reliable, it's a """"soft fact"""". It's just opinion. Yes, published articles are verifiable, but so what? An alternative system would be one where the Wikipedia author looks at other (offered) articles, examines them for credibility and rationality (even if the article contradicts the existing orthodoxy), and then decides whether to include a given link. But the boot-strapping system as employed by Wikipedia is illogical and is not likely to produce accurate or reliable articles. It's just as likely, if not more likely, to propogate misinformation. I won't be editing the Ariel page. Ultimately, faith underpins everything, not least the credibility of verifiable sources. If the Ariel page is wrong now, which it is, then it's will stay wrong for some time - and if that doesn't illustrate the fundamental weakness of the """"verifiability"""" dogma, then I don't know what does."""

7107,"TRPV1 agonist? 

It makes no sense. TRPV1 activation causes pain or heat sensation. Capsaicine is known to activate the receptor, and that's what makes chili pungent. If one of the reasons for AM404 being an analgetic was TRPV1 activation, it would have to be the opposite to that of capsaicine. The only wat in which TRPV1 agonism would decrease pain is that a prolonged exposure to high doses of the agonist decreases the sensitivity, which is the case in any type of receptor activation, but this would mean that AM404 is no more an analgetic than capsaicine or any other source of pain... and the relief would come after a period of pain actually getting worse.

Can anyone explain all this?"

16810,"""Hey Malik Shabazz- how's it feel to know I played you like a fool? This dumb racist wannabe-Jew moron actually thought he was having an intellectual discussion with """"ElliotJoyce"""" when """"ElliotJoyce"""" was none other than """"Vost"""", the same user that had ripped Malik Shabazz a new asshole months earlier. But you know what the funniest part of all this is? I WIN. I literally have about 17 other accounts that have absolutely nothing to do with """"Vost"""", """"ElliotJoyce"""", or """"Accreditor"""", and I've used those accounts to transform Wikipedia articles to match my tastes, which usually means countering the racist garbage from pseudo-intellectual cancers like you sweety. See, from all of the edits I do, you dumb idiots pick up only a fraction to revert- while I've been keeping you busy with Vost socks (which itself is a sock of another account), I've committed over 200 edits under the radar from special-proxy rotations in the last 4 days. I have 2 admin accounts, 5 non-admin accounts of previously active users which I've since been able to commandeer (more on this later), and about 10 standard self-created accounts. What's even more hilarious is that the reverts engendered by my socks usually cause enough notice to the article that I don't even have to do anything to get my views to dominate: I let other users add fuel to the fire that I started. But you know what the absolute kicker to all of this is? I got you, yes you, you Jew-wannabe, black racist cancer smear, to violate numerous Wikipedia policies and your own Wikipedia philosophy by going after me, vendetta style. I BROKE YOU ON YOUR OWN TERMS. And even after all that, my major points and edits prevailed. I win, and considering that your power level on Wikipedia is considerably more entrenched than my own, my victory is that much more devastating. The IP I'm using at the moment, courtesy of the 24-hour computer lab in my dorm, is about 1 of thousands of batch IPs I have access to, which gives me even greater security and privilege to spread myself over Wikipedia in case my special proxy rotation is ever categorized as a proxy, and thus blocked. Oh, and regarding the commandeering of accounts: graphical analysis password bypass and deconstruction (GAPBAD) is a rather effective means to obliterate CAPTCHA; its use is only feasible at specific time intervals when security measures on the target fluctuate or do not register properly. Guess which account is getting targeted next as soon as Wikipedia undergoes its next server hash? ). You've been warned in advance. Just remember: I win. You can't do anything to me. Go back to being a Jew-wannabe sweety. Jews are white, not black. Remember that too- that's why you're not accepted and never will be accepted by mainstream Judaism or Western society as Jewish. OWNED. How's that taste? L M F A O."""

Crime
first of all you need to monitor that """"Lanicoya"""" that just because she is from Nicaragua tries to take advantage of that to try to keep sections from being created. managua is a dangerous city and wether she like it or not it needs a crime section like san jose costa rica has one and like san salvador el salvador has one. Nicaragua Managua is not a safe city okay i had copy the article word by word and it now has been chaged okay. here it is.

The Regional Security Office U.S. Embassy in Managua reported these incidents: 

Crime in Nicaragua is in high rise and the National Police does not have the resources to combat it. Crime in Managua has had a steady growth throughout the years. Managua the capital of Nicaragua is exceptionally extremely dangerous specially at night, street crime is very common. Majority of the violent crime that is on the rise is due to the countries extreme poverty and lack of jobs. The following incidents took place in March and April of this year 2007. 

Hotel Robberies 

On March 29, an American couple visited the city of Granada where they where robbed at gunpoint in their rental home. Several days before the couple was robbed they contacted the management about a missing light in the unit. At 11:30 a.m. on the day of the robbery, a Nicaraguan male in his late 20s (the suspect) was at the front gate of the property he said that he was there to fix the light. The victim walked the individual inside the home, where he inspected the light. The victim then walked the suspect outside so he could get his tools. As they got near the front door, the suspect stopped and pulled out what the victim described was a .25 caliber or similar to the type automatic pistol and demanded the American couple give him all their money. The suspect took the victim’s wallet, took all of the cash and then, at the victims request his wallet was returned holding only his identification, The suspect then departed the area on foot. 

On April 4, seventeen members of a U.S. missionary group were robbed at gunpoint while having dinner at their hotel in Managua. The U.S. missionary group was given housing at a locally-owned hotel located in a area not frequented by tourists. Four Nicaraguan males, including two armed with handguns, entered the dining room and took the group’s cell phones and all their money. Two of the suspects walked the members of the U.S missionary group to their hotel rooms where they stole their digital cameras, additional cash and iPods. The robbery lasted one hour, a hotel employee was able to get away and called the Nicaraguan National Police (NNP). The Nicaraguan National Police did not arrive, however, until after the suspects had left the scene. None of the victims were badly hurt. 

The Regional Security Office U.S. Embassy in Managua strongly recommends all visitors and tourists to Nicaragua utilize hotels and guest houses that have a front desk, security, or concierge that is staffed 24 hours a day; full-time uniformed security; access control precautions; a fenced perimeter and a well lit and patrolled parking area; and rooms equipped with safes for valuables and travel documents. 

Vehicular Break-Ins

In the early afternoon on April 21, a vehicle belonging to an American organization was broken into at a gas station in Managua. The vehicle had stopped at the gas station on Carretera Sur (South Highway), about two miles from the U.S. Embassy in Managua. When leaving the car to make purchases in the station store, a young Nicaraguan male approached the driver and said he’d watch the vehicle for money. The driver accepted this offer and the car’s passengers entered the gas station. When leaving the gas station, they found that the young Nicaraguan male who had offered to watch the car was already gone and they noticed that the rear passenger door window had been broken. A briefcase that held files and their identification documents where also taken from the rear seat. The young male who had offered to watch the car returned to the scene. The NNP took him in to further investigate the case but were unable to confirm his direct involvement in the crime. 

The Regional Security Office U.S. Embassy Managua recommends that travelers do not leave valuables where they can be seen in parked cars and, when possible, park in a location where the vehicle can be monitored or where they have cameras.

I was acting on the advice of the admin who blocked you. The responses have a great deal of value, particularly as they're from experienced editors, rather than SPAs with fewer than 500 edits.  (talk) (contributions) 
I agree with Carl and other users that it is important for material to be properly sourced and to avoid original research and synthesis. I was concerned with the first sentence in the section Spin added:
For centuries the common story of the birth of Jesus has been a product of the two birth narratives in Matthew and Luke, but it is not easy to understand the progress of the individual birth narrative in each gospel, because the content of the other narrative is already too well ingrained in our approach to the material, so, in order to clarify the relationship between them, the basic elements are compared in the following table.'
The assertion that """"it is not easy to understand the progress of the individual birth narrative in each gospel"""" is a matter of opinion and needs an in-line citation refering to a reliable source. Same thing for the assertion """"because the content of the other narrative is already too well ingrained in our approach to the material"""". According to whom? Once again, it needs to refer to a reliable source.
It may be more productive to show the suggested section and table on this talk page or on a sub-page and then have editors comment and work through differences before adding the material into the article. At present there's no consensus to add the material, which means that Spin puts something in and then another editor like Carl removes it. In situations like this it's best to slow down, follow 1RR, and work through issues through talk page conversations. Alternatively, third opinions or other dispute resolution mechanism may help. Cheers,  
For the moment I have removed the introductory comment and left the original statement. (I'll just remind you of all the Christmas creches which depict the shepherds and the magi together, all the paintings which do the same, the comments here of people who cannot accept the scholarly opinion that Matthew has Joseph living in Bethlehem only to move to Nazareth at the end of the narrative.) 
I don't understand how a person will work through issues when they have successfully erased the material. One needs to be constructive to make progress on Wiki, not destructive. It is the dialog which allows progress. If a person doesn't want to enter into a constructive dialog, then it doesn't matter how one proceeds. 
So, how about it, Carl Bunderson, can you be constructive on the issue?  control 
I have been constructive until I am blue in the face. You've no sense of how OR, RS, and primary sources all interact. A clear majority of persons have indicated that your edits are inappropriate, you merely obstinately refuse to acknowledge it. Talking to you does absolutely no good.  (talk) (contributions) 
You have not been at all constructive. You don't use the notion of primary sources as indicated in the material I've already quoted. All you've done is to opine that it is OR which it plainly isn't. You don't give constructive indications as to how to improve the material. Constructive indications involve proposing alternatives that would make the material acceptable to you. As to primary sources, again, this is what Wiki says:
Primary sources that have been reliably published (for example, by a university press or mainstream newspaper) may be used in Wikipedia, but only with care, because it is easy to misuse them. Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation. Without a secondary source, a primary source may be used only to make descriptive claims, the accuracy of which is verifiable by a reasonable, educated person without specialist knowledge. For example, an article about a novel may cite passages from the novel to describe the plot, but any interpretation of those passages needs a secondary source.
I make no conclusions about the material. I don't make any interpretations of the material. You seem to me to simply be wrong in your interpretation of the rules.  control 22:"""

A number of conquest attempts were launched against Prussia by Poland, (ref External link William Pierson book), also
] Chronicon Polonor. Ongoing military attacks in order to subjugate Prussia. Labuda disputes this. 

Marija Gimbutas in her book: The Balts - describes the Prussian and Baltic territory reaching much further west, south, south-west, south-east than the later Prussia, when Poland came into existense and conquered much additional territory (claimed by Polish to have been a """"uniting of Polish tribes""""), however for centuries rejected and fought against by the ones involved.

Prussians are also recorded as Ulmerugi, Holmrugi (Island Rugians in the Vistula river area. That name still showed up on maps of area around Culm, Culmerland, Kulmerland territory which was surrounded by the Vistula river.  

Boleslaw I claimed to have conquered (part of) the Prussians and even his headstone is supposed to have shown something like this. He also claimed to have put 'columns' (pillars) up in the newly conquered Prussian territory, to mark the new border of territory, which he now claimed as his, which was not his.

So ,Szopen, Culmerland was not Polish land- it was Prussian land, partially conquered temporarily by Poland. 

Gethen, Getae is yet another name for the Prussians, that name was still known to Polish historians as well.

Szopen's mentioning of Bruno of Querfurt as having taken part in Boleslaw I battles against Prussians 1015 also makes no sense, because Bruno was dead since 1009."""

Okay with regards to that last little comment: How about you try choking on my balls you over 
excitable ancient. Forgive my antagonism but I give only as much as I receive, and I have most 
certainly received a substantial quantity from you. You may try to come across as a cool headed and fair moderator. In reality I would liken you more to a tyrant; nay to an immature little boy, despite your years (oh and so many of them there are). Without hardly a glance you toss aside any changes you can't verify with the limitless tome you assume your mind to be. And what of those whose revisions you've mindlessly reverted, you dispatch to them on mass pseudo-endearments and generic warnings such as the one seen above. I will admit to you that I have committed much wiki-vandalism in the past such as my early editing of Neil Peart but how is it that you cannot overlook the past and accept the legitimate revisions and improvements I and others have been making. I stand by my edit regarding Charles Nohh though I have given up trying to penetrate you tightly closed mind (which I will add in my rage is quite the adverse of what I would say about your wife). Furthermore having calmed myself I should mention a little about who I am. If you can recall (Of this there is little hope) you once likened my writing to that found in """"chat-rooms"""" and believe me when I say I did not LOL over that comment. I was at the time of our encounter studying a BA with a major in Creative English Writing. You should note before you jump to the conclusion that I dropped out as I suspect you would in your typical """"angry"""" way: not only have I graduated, I continued my study for a further year and obtained honors. I was working at the time as a contributor to a Wellington Based Music Interest Magazine, and had convinced the Fuehrer (my editor) to publish an article I wrote on Rush. It was while I was researching for this article that I came across the information which I added to the Neil Peart article. So thanks to you my small contribution was only read by the handful of New Zealanders who read my work, when it could have informed in whatever small way the countless many who may have stumbled upon it on the internet. So Thank YOU Anger22. It is your obsession with reversion resulting I must assume in a complete disregard of duty to family or perhaps a complete disconnection from the living world, I say again it is this obsession which keeps this website from being everything it should be.

Hey Koreans, who the fuck do you think you're dealing with. Guess what, Gaogouli was a Chinese vassal you stupid fucks. After the fall of the Tang Dynasty, close to 700,000 were incorporated into Tang history, a little less than half migrated to the Central Plains, 100,000 to the Chinese state of Bohai and only 100,000 into Xinluo (Silla). Most Gaogouli descendants are Chinese.

With the sole exception of Ansi fort itself, Tang troops destroyed Gaogouli soldiers on the battlefield, despite being a significantly smaller force. If anything, Gaogouli only DEFENDED itself from assaults from Sui and Tang. Gaogouli was a mere Chinese vassal, nothing more. The greatest threat came from the TuBo, TuJue and HuiHe from the west. Koreans are a bunch of fucking attention whores.

You fucking barbarian kimchi gooks have a lot of nerve to badmouth your former masters, considering the fact that you were our little dog for most of your existance.

You know, I've just been having this discussion on my talk page.  interesting.  What we currently have on project is a kind of pre-tribal band system, which can look like any other system (because the elements of all sophisticated political systems are present 'in the bud' in social bands). There are some elements of tribal society developing (Arbcom and administrators fill a role 'tribal elders' in loose tribal aggregates, policy and guidelines take on an almost mystical/devotional role in some discussions), but on individual pages it still largely devolves to conflicts between small ideologically insular groups fighting for control of a resource.  Aristocracy in any sense of the term would be a superior system; in Aristotle's sense it would be far superior.  

I'll admit that I'm a huge fan of consensus systems (I live for deliberative democracy…), but consensus systems are hard: they take a lot of self-reflection, a lot of self-moderation, and both a willingness and an ability to set aside small personal concerns in favor of large public concerns.  These features are noticeably absent from many of the more contentious discussions on project.  If we are not willing to take the steps to achieve a properly functioning consensus system, then we would really do better to try for another less-open approach, because dysfunctional consensus systems are ugly, ugly, ugly beasts.  It's why Aristotle considered 'democracy' the worst form of governance (because his understanding of democracy was more-or-less rule by the ignorant and emotionally volatile masses).  Ludwigs2 """

Why then am I not insisting on including the following pictures in the article?

If you are insist on including a picture that you think is of real importance to the article, I will also insist on adding the above two pictures which I believe are of great importance as well. The point I am trying to make is that the article Secunderabad discusses several aspects of Secunderabad and not just architecture. The number of pictures in each section should be proportionate to the length of that section. We have enough pictures for the section on architecture. A mention and description of important structures should suffice.
As for the other pictures you have pointed out. I beleive the picture of Garden restaurant has nothing to do with advertisement. The restaurant is a local landmark and is therefore of significance. Pictures of locally famous restaurants are often featured in wikipedia articles about cities. Refer Cafe du Monde picture in New Orleans. The Tankbund road picture is also significant. It is an important thoroughfare in the city which acts as the main arterial road that connects the cities of Hyderabad and Secunderaabd. As for the Parade Grounds picture, I'm not contesting its significance or insignificance. However it doesn't hurt to keep the picture. I hope I cleared things up a bit. Thanks"

 musings 

hey friday

while blocked the past two days i read through your subpages.   things like /admin etc.  they are great!

i'm burning out on this project  editing can be a lot of fun but in the recent past i've received so many hassles from editors following me around and admins interpreting policies liberally in order to block me.   i also saw that i'm not the only one who's been on the receiving end of this.   i've seen it all but its too long to go into here.  i'm not sure if these are new trends or just something i haven't spent the time to look into before.  

""""mere editors"""" really have little recourse in this.   filing arbitration proved exhausting for me in the past.   it required a huge amount of diff hunting and discussion for what seemed to me was a pretty obvious case of an out-of-line editor.   filing against an admin would, i assume, be much, much worse.   admins seem to behave like inner-city police with their wall of silence.

a lot of your comments show that you've noticed the same happenings.  in an ideal world i think you are right  people would behave reasonably...but i am pessimistic that will happen.   i have come to the conclusion that the only solution is to firm up wikis policies.   we need to define what something like """"disruption"""" is.   when someone is blocked for a personal attack, the diff should be included.   that a requirement for including evidence is controversial is evidence that it time for change; we've tried the """"trust admins to do what is right"""".   it has failed.

FALCON"
857,"Absolute Proof that 0.999... IS NOT EQUAL TO 1 
A math-wiki:

You are wrong about infinite representation. The ancient Greeks *never* represented 1/3 as 0.333... 

Now let me refute your argument regarding the transitive property:

A)    1=3(1/3)
B)    3(1/3) = 3(0.333...)
C)    3(0.333...) =0.999... 

The problem here occurs in B) where you assume that 3 * 0.333... = 3 * 1/3. You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. 
0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any
radix system.

You mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r
such that a=bq + r and  0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then 
what are the integers q and r such that the above is true?

Suppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively.
For example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, the
division algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the Greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times.

Now suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction:

1=(0.999...)(0)+1. The second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. But how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!!

That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.

Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.

Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""

Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""

Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.

""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""

Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.

He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.

""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.

""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""

For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.

Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""

""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.

With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.

Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.

Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.

Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now. 

Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page.

 Dear Helladios can you stop deleting my input. You have no right to censore someone elses opinion. You are not God. Napoleon Zervas his behaviour was questionable and important for the prosecution of the people

""""Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced"""" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:

Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.
During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.

Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.

As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.

The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book """"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia"""", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that """"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek"""" .

The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.

On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.

During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses and places of worship were burned dow"

Karljoos, you ignorantly state that the phillipines is a hispanic country? How in the hell is that possible? Phillipino people are not spaniard nor have there been any admixture between spaniards and phillipines over the centuries. Are you ok?

Also, according to europeans (not ignorant americans), hispanic is an admixture of races in south america. Therefore, spaniards are not classified as hispanic. 

Then you state that Spanish culture has taken root in south america. This is not wholly true. Although it is true that south americans have accepted parts of Spanish culture, they still retain features of their own culture that are extremely distinct from the Spanish culture. This is compounded further by south america’s distinct racial differences, which, if you were smart, you would indeed know.

Just for the record, I am of spaniard descent. I do not consider myself hispanic in the way that ignorant stupid americans do. All europeans don’t view spaniards as hispanic, as a matter of fact. 

Also, since stupid americans consider south americans hispanic, it should be therefore fair to classify afro-americans and native americans in america as anglo-saxons also. This is due to the fact that afro-americans and native americans possess a significant amount of their bloodline to anglo-saxon admixture. As a result, I will add this fact to wikipedia’s anglo-saxon article. AND I WILL BACK THIS UP WITH GOOD SOURCES. So, I better not get idiot americans disputing this."

Speedy deletion of Adam Warin

Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

First, trying to pull """"rank"""" with me, is not an effective way to be persusive with me or to appear as an ally or friendly. Second, you have misread my statement and missed my major point about vagina and penis. The point is that the article itself explans that a vaginoplasty is surgery to create a vagina. It is therefore obvious that any photographs of surgery in and around a penis or vagina will contain such things in the photograph. I believe that is is entirely appropriate to set the example that photographs of genitalia in medical and educational contexts are appropriate for all audiences. I believe that the precedent should be set that the penis and the vagina or more accurately in most cases the vulva should not be given special attention in medical contexts. To do so, gives the misimpression that there is something """"wrong"""" with human genitalia, which is a falsehood, and an antedeluvian cultural bias whose primitive nature should be abolished. In this century and millenium, is it time for such puritanical prudishness to end. One of the best ironies of discussions about such """"warnings"""" around medical photos is that they primarily serve to heighten the existence and nature of the photographs, and probably invite more study of them than might otherwise occur. In other words, they have the opposite of their intended purpose. The tend to draw more attention to such material, than might otherwise occur, while the tacit intention of people who want to put similarly silly warnings about such material is to """"hide"""" them and be bashful around them. It is high time that humans grow up and get over this silly aversions to the site of human genitalia. The wikipedia should be a place that sets an appropriate standard that medical information should be free from the psuedo censorship that such """"warnings"""" represent. On another note, on the basis of WP:V, a large portion of the wikipedia would be candidate for deletion. I believe such mention constitutes evidence that this article is being given unfair over-attention by a tacit faction whose true purpose is to censor subjects like the sort to which Toby Meltzer and its """"Good Article"""" subject matter relates. First and foremost, such good articles serve to refute the rampant misinformation in the minds of the average populace.  21:17, 17 September 2006."""

Again, I don't think this is productive, but I'll make my position clear anyway. Oppose. There are some sources here that support the idea that various types of nuclear power have been considered as sustainable, but that wasn't the only reason the IPs edits were reverted. This is one reason tying this into the above discussion is a bad idea, because this isn't just about the academic consensus on a loosely defined """"type of nuclear fission"""". Using the article to explain in context that nuclear power is in some ways sustainable, according to some points of view, would be fine. The edits introduced large quantities relatively weakly sourced material to present nuclear as being a primary and uncontroversial source of sustainable energy. The above sources support mentioning nuclear as one aspect of sustainability. They do not warrant altering the article to make nuclear energy the first specific section, nor do they warrant excessive ref-bombing to support that perspective, while using similarly selective tactics to undermine those who hold a more critical perspective. This isn't just about verifiability, this is also about WP:WEIGHT. Even the sources presented here indicate that nuclear's sustainability is under-researched and hinges on too many unknowns to be accepted without further comment. This is true for many areas of sustainable energy research, but especially nuclear. It is an active area of research (or areas, rather) which has a relatively small but extremely vocal core of active supporters. This should not be used to diminish that perspective or the potentially revolutionary research, but major context was being selectively left-out from the proposed edits.   """

Do you think this confirms the existence of unfermented kimchi against all sources I gathered? Someone might like to have a bite of Sauerkraut before it is fermented. 
I don't want to argue with you or something, but I have heard that beer is made from only malt, hops, and water in Germany (as it should be). Unfortunately, at least in Korea, Japan, and the U.S., most beer includes rice, potato, corn starch, and many other ingredients I think unnecessary. At least they have ingredient lists on the bottles, and there are a lot of official documents on those additional ingredients.
But kimchi is a different story. Like I said, I have never seen any packaged/jarred kimchi labeled """"unfermented"""", maybe except for Japanses """"kimuchi"""" which is more like pickled vegetables. And both traditional and contemporary kimchi is fermented. (they are not much different anyway.) Nevertheless, I am willing to temper my claim if editors can find even a couple of reliable sources that say some kimchi is unfermented.

Well, two counter-points and an attempt to help you see the main point again.  First, you authoritatively state yellowcake would """"barely qualify"""" as a dirty bomb but it is not clear what standard you are using since the AP article states the following.  """"Exposure carries well-documented health concerns associated with heavy metals such as damage to internal organs, experts say. """"The big problem comes with any inhalation of any of the yellowcake dust,"""" said Doug Brugge, a professor of public health issues at the Tufts University School of Medicine"""".  Second, the AP article notes there is """"remaining radioactive debris"""" at Tuwaitha.  I'm not sure if you've been on the ground (I leave that possibility open) but unless you have a source to back up your point, the AP article reads like there is other material there that are radiological.  But if we are actually reasoning together you will see that is not my main point about why we should post the AP article.  The AP source reaffirms that Iraq did have WMD material; known or unknown it not the point.  You claim yellowcake is not WMD material but the Canadians bought it to make nuclear energy so your definition of WMD material seems personal.  The reader of this entry on WMD should know that Iraq had this material and if not, this section of the site is imbalanced.  That is my point."""

Thanks for the support... by the time you added that comment I'd changed the tautology para, and removed all the others so I'm not clear which """"current"""" para you mean. Quite a lot of consilidation done tonight; I'm much happier with the current text than before. From my POV the main remaining problem is the lead paragraph which I hope the current text demonstates is seriously misleading. Here is my proposed new version:

In physics and cosmology, the anthropic principle was originally the rule of reasoning that we should take account of the constraints that our existence as observers imposes on the sort of universe that we could observe. The term has since been extended to cover supposed """"superlaws"""" that in various ways require the universe to support intelligent life, usually assumed to be carbon-based, and occasionally to be specifically human beings. Anthropic reasoning involves assessing these constraints by analysing the properties of universes with different fundamental parameters or laws of physics from ours, and has frequently concluded that essential structures, from atomic nuclei to the whole universe, depend for stability on delicate balances between different fundamental forces; balances which only occur in a small minority of possible universes — so that ours seems to be  fine-tuned for life. Anthropic reasoning also attempts to explain and quantify this fine tuning. Within the scientific community the usual approach is to invoke selection effects from a real ensemble of alternate universes; competing strategies, occasionally also called anthropic, include intelligent Design. 
 
This would allow some shortening of the second para discussing controversies. You can see that I plan to have Anthropic reasoning re-direct to this page.  You can also see that I think we should avoid getting hung up on the tautologous nature of some statements of the AP (including the one you like), because I do think that misses the point.(c.f. new first para to the Character of Anthropic reasoning section). Oh, another proposal: merge the Bostrom section into the Variants, i.e. add his self sampling assumption as an AP-type statement. What do you think?  """

You will have noticed that some people wish to erase borg's 1982 performances from the record . As fas as l'm concerned inspecial tournament he played well and had no bad losses; so he is a legit player.

Tennus expert is acting like a pain in the neck again. Date ranges are preferable
 and self explanatory. the man is so[petty and full of himself its beyond a joke. You should change the date to finish of the event like the french version if you can't do the date range. Laver often played more than 2 events in a week like his wins at bretton woods and canadian open in the week of 10-16 aug 1970

Sorry it's taken so long to get back to you on that. Between the Wikipedia ban and the whole trial for rape mess (long story), I've been a little busy.

To answer you: If you didn't read anything about me on my page, or my felony list (AKA my talk page), I am going to work/work/worked (that's my anti-identity paranoia, so you can't figure anything out) as a freelance writer. 

I was doing a science-fictional Fredric Brown-style vignette, which involved llamas. I was stuck for a piece about the anatomy of the, and wanted to figure out something about what llamas are made of, and happened to see that piece you did up at the top of the page. Thanks to that, I started thinking about something completely different, that actually made the entire story a helluva lot better.

The fire-breathing llamas were just what I needed.

Thanks a lot for the tip (although I know you didn't mean it). If you get a user page, drop me a line. These editors are crazy over any little thing you do, so I should continue this outside of the site (this note alone is enough evidence for the Wikijury to have me drawn and quartered, as my rap sheet indicates).

Good luck!"

Thanks, but it was not a simple 'disagreement about an article'. Please read this.

He made no attempt to simply fix the error. He made no attempt to contact me so I could fix the error. He then implied he did NOT delete everything, when he should have at least apologized for that error. He blamed me for everything, and in an insulting, condescending, arrogant way. Finally, he selectively edited our disagreement on his Talk page to make himself appear to be in the right. As a supposedly experienced Administrator (I note he started editing in 2003), all that is very wrong. I refuse to waste my time with a project which puts destructive people in leadership positions.

The method used is the Algebraic Topology of PDE's formulated by A. Prástaro in a series of early published works on the geometric theory of PDE's and the characterization of their global solutions by means of suitable bordism groups.

In particular in [1] and [2] it is proved the following theorem.

Theorem [Integral h-cobordism in Ricci flow PDE's]
The Ricci flow equation for n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, admits that starting from a n-dimensional sphere S^n, we can dynamically arrive, into a finite time, to any n-dimensional homotopy sphere $M$. When this is realized with a smooth solution, i.e., solution with characteristic flow without singular points, then S^n is diffeomorphic to M. The other homotopy spheres \Sigma^n, that are homeomorphic to S^n only, are reached by means of singular solutions.
In particular, for n belonging equal to 1,2,3,4,5,6,  one has also that any smooth n-dimensional homotopy sphere M is diffeomorphic to S^n. In particular, the case n=4, is related to the proof that the smooth Poincaré conjecture is true."

I have been wondering about Polycheles typhlops. I would have nominated it myself for DYK, if only I had been able to find a good hook. It really is a fascinating animal, but there's nothing (cited) in the text that jumped out as instantly notable. I agree that the """"two species"""" claim is false, and that the reference proves it (planktonic larvae can be easier to find than animals living on the sea floor at depths of >2000 m, so it's not that surprising that species have been missed). I wasn't sure if someone else would find a good way of re-wording it and save the DYK entry; I certainly couldn't think of one, but I didn't vote it down just in case. That DOI is an odd thing indeed. Springer Link definitely gives the same DOI I put in the article, but dx.doi.org doesn't recognise it. It's not even as if it's a very new article that hasn't made it into the DOI database yet.

 From previous posts, learned that page direction was for terminology, not necessarily biology. But added more succinct genetic information citation to definition, making the body of the text heavier.  Added short biology section because of this.
 Found more usage of the term """"black sheep."""" Depending on the group culture using the phrase, it was either positive or negative, so further clarified usage by splitting the term into two groupings with citations and examples for each.  I know Baa Baa Black Sheep was removed once.  However, it is an example of the use of the term.  The other examples should be obvious.  If not how do I clarify.

The TIGHAR-Nikumaroro Fiasco
Two years of speculation and hype came to a numbing climax on
March 16, 1992, at the National Press Club in Washington,
D.C. At a crowded news conference receiving national TV
coverage, Richard Gillespie, executive director of The International
Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery [TIGHAR], unabashedly
announced that the Amelia Earhart mystery “is solved.”
Since early 1990, following the group’s first excursion to Nikumaroro,
a 3.5-mile long coral atoll in the Phoenix Islands, about 2,100 miles
southwest of Hawaii and three hundred miles south of Howland Island,
the national media had touted TIGHAR’s theory that Nikumaroro could
be the final resting place of Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan.
The “evidence” Gillespie presented included a battered piece of aluminum,
a weathered size 9 shoe sole labeled “Cat’s Paw Rubber Co.,
USA,” a small brass eyelet, and another unlabeled heel the group found
on Nikumaroro during TIGHAR’s highly publicized return there in
October 1991. These items, elaborately displayed and labeled in a glass
case, all came from Earhart or her Electra, according to Gillespie.
“There may be conflicting opinions, but there is no conflicting evidence,”
Gillespie said. “I submit that the case is solved.” Gillespie then
bit his lip and looked down at the floor — a curious yet revealing display
of body language for someone claiming to have solved one of the
20th century’s greatest mysteries.
Gillespie and Patricia R. Thrasher, TIGHAR’s husband-and-wife
team, theorize that through a navigational error, Earhart and Noonan
overflew Howland Island and landed on a reef on Nikumaroro during
low tide. There they died of dehydration a short time later. The plane,
they said, was washed over the reef when the tide came in and now lies
under 2,000 feet of ocean.
The April 1992 Life magazine featured a six-page spread penned by
Gillespie, who cites Navy pilot John Lambrecht’s July 9, 1937 report:
“Signs of recent human habitation were clearly visible [on
Nikumaroro], but “repeated circling and zooming failed to elicit any
answering wave from possible inhabitants.” Gillespie called this report
“hugely significant” and “tragically inadequate. What had not been
done in 1937 had to be done now. We would have to search
Nikumaroro.”
Gillespie credited two retired military aviators, Tom Gannon and
Tom Willi, of Fort Walton Beach, Florida, for the theory’s origin.
“Using celestial tables, Gannon pointed out that on the morning of July
2, 1937, the rising sun would have provided the precise line of position
Earhart said she was running,” Gillespie wrote in Life. “By flying
southeast along that line, Noonan could be sure that, even if he missed
Howland, he would reach an island in the Phoenix group in about two
hours. Clearly it was the safest, sanest course to follow. I traced the line
on the chart and read the name of the island: Nikumaroro.”
This supposition was convincing to some, but Devine wasn’t
impressed. “There is considerable information in Gillespie’s rendition that
can be faulted,” Devine writes. “One example is his attempt to foster a line
between Howland Island and Nikumaroro. He presents Earhart’s last message
as ‘We are on line 157/337 ... We are running on line.’
Earhart never reached Howland Island. Earhart never
saw Howland Island, therefore Howland Island is not a reference
point for a landing on Nikumaroro. Earhart’s authentic
last message received by Coast Guard personnel on board
the Itasca, and recorded by Commander Thompson, related
no reference point: ‘We are on line of position 157-337 ...
We are running north and south.’ Earhart was not flying east
toward Howland Island or Hawaii. She was on a course, a
compass course or line of position 157-337, which terminates
on the island of Saipan.1
With Our Own Eyes
– 163 –
– 164 –
Earhart was not adept at navigation, and may have stated
her reading from a pocket compass she carried on her person.
She was probably and almost certainly stressed by ensuing
events, especially if Noonan had been rendered unconscious
during the almost disastrous takeoff of the overladen plane.
If Noonan had not been incapacitated, I assure you that he,
one of the best air-and-sea navigators of that period, would
have been communicating. He would have guided their
plane on a pre-arranged course, and calculated for accura"

 The precise definition of race is under dispute 

I wrote this to help spread understanding, please make sure to read the definitions of outcrossing on the link.

There is a lot of misunderstanding of genetics and further there is a lot of misinformation that people spread because they WANT you to think that there is no difference between peoples for a political or social agenda, that does not make it so. Humans share 98% of our genetic code with Chimpanzees, yet that 2% defines our differences and is important as is the difference in the human population, no matter how small the difference.

There are obviously differences in the expressed traits between Asian, African and Caucasian. These are different types of humans, if you choose to call the a race/breed or type it's up to you and it's immaterial. My argument has always been that racial diversity should be preserved which is a more neutral position rather than promoting that race mixing and interbreeding is somehow positive.

You and many people that listen to pop culture may think that by interbreeding you are helping humanity and there are lots of myths about how you will create better offspring; offspring that have the best of both parents. This is just a myth told by people who, are trying to say that people are equal, if different. Yes, people are people as Americans we believe that all people have certain inalienable rights but the best position for humanity is for each of the races to exist, separately to be the best we can. If you truly understand the advantages that diversity offers you will agree too.

I personally breed horses. And this is where I'll start telling you a story: the Thoroughbred horse started out as a mixed race horse. It was based on Arab stock and was bred only for speed for many generations, regardless of breed, the horse that ran the race the fastest was bred to other fast horses. The Thoroughbred breeding book is now closed, which means you cannot breed a Thoroughbred to any other breed, because, ANY cross you make outside of the gene pool will reduce the speed of the horse. This is called line breeding, please read this article as a basic """"learn to breed"""" guideline: http://www.learntobreed.com/linebreeding.html. Line breeding(inbreeding) is a useful technique as is outcrossing when advantagous to produce quality results, random mixing is like a child finger-painting and does nothing positive.

What Wikipedia has been proposing is that random interbreeding is potentially a good idea and should be treated as potentially positive. Any person who knows about breeding animals will disagree, it's very unlikely that race mixing will result in a positive result unless it was planned for by a geneticist. When you cited the plant hybridization, that's what you were doing citing a hybrid that was designed in a laboratory and there were not human beings or living animals as a result of a genetic mistake. You can't through bad human crosses in the trash like you can with corn."""

In the English language: An electric bass could mean any electrified bass instrument: electric bass guitar, electric double bass...

I'd say Vunzmstr is trying to improve the naming accuracy. A bass could be: a tuba, a low voice, the Basso voice range. Bass guitars and guitars simply have more in common than the bass guitar and the double bass, which belongs to the violin family, while the (electric) bass/bass guitar does not. Note the first (commercially successful) bass guitar: it was built by Leo Fender, not by Stradivarius!
Differences between bass guitar and double bass:
 playing technique: one may use a bow for the double bass
 design: the bass guitar is a direct derivative of the guitar (both electric and acoustic), while the double bass was derived from the violoncello
 octave: the bass guitar is one octave lower than the guitar, the double bass an extra octave lower

Add to this that the number of electrified bass instruments may increase in the near future, further reducing the clarity of """"electric bass"""".

Do you think it OK to use the total population of England as the indicator for the numbers of English in England. If that is the case then for the Cornish people page the total population of Cornwall should be used for the numbers of Cornish?.

Secondly it is not my claim that there are 250,000 Cornish people so what are you going on about? All i have added of late is that a recent survey found that 44% of the Cornish populace thought themselves Cornish rather than British or English.

according to a recent Morgan Stanley Bank survey, 44 per cent of the inhabitants of Cornwall believe themselves to be Cornish rather than British or English 

Here are some more links so you can find out a bit more about what you are trying to comment on.

Then Ben Stiller arrived 10 minutes after the commentary started and then started arguing with the director Rawson Marshall Thurber and even burping sometimes. After about 25 minutes Thurber becomes very annoyed with the stupidity of Ben Stiller and leaves the studio. Then both Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn did anything besides commenting the film, with Vaughn even threatening the crew at the studio. After about 40 minutes from the beginning of the commentary a woman comes in the studio and tells Ben that if he doesn't move his car it will be towed. After this both Stiller and Vaughn leave the studio with almost an hour left in the film! The two men of the studio crew then, in total embarassment, put on the commentary of There's Something about Mary. This proves the complete unprofessionality of Vaughn and Stiller. They behaved awfully, Stiller, after 5 minutes of his arrival wanted to leave and Vaughn insulted one of the studio crew members and, after Thurber went away they began criticizing him.

(deindent) Sorry for kibitzing, but I wanted to be fair to all points of view, even those of the dualists. so I tried to stick to presenting the thought experiments without drawing conclusions.

The thought experiment is this:

 you have one observer
 The observer gets cloned into copy 1 and copy 2 (either Hubert/Yorick or star-trek style)
 The copies diverge, either because of internal noise, or because of the environment

From a third person point of view, this is an objective description of the evolution of a physical system, there is absolutely no ambiguity about what is going on- one observer becomes two. If probed, each copy would say that they were the initial observer before the cloning event. But viewed from the inside, if you are the observer getting cloned, there is a very natural question you can ask: Am I going to end up being copy 1 or am I going to be copy 2? This question cannot even be formulated from the outside, so it has no objective answer, but it is subjectively very important if you are the observer.

This scenario is Dennett's (and to some extent Everett's). Since the question doesn't even make sense when formulated in the third person perspective, the answer to this question does not lie in the position and velocities of any atoms. You might conclude that this question doesn't make any sense. But, in any case, the answer to this question is 1 bit of subjective information which both copy 1 and copy 2 know, and which the original observer does not. In the objective third person view, there is no information gained- you know that copy 1 will say """"I am copy 1"""" and copy 2 will say """"I am copy 2"""".

To give an example of actual OR and SYNTH, I'll go beyond Dennett's example: suppose that the copying goes on indefinitely, so that the cloning keeps happening again and again. Then it is very difficult to say what it feels like for the observer, from the first person perspective. For example, take a star-trek duplicator, and duplicate the observer, and then duplicate each duplicate, but add a twist: the duplicator keeps the data from the first duplication event in its memory banks, and makes a third copy in the exact same state twenty years later, and starts duplicating that observer too in the same way. And then it does so again forty years later, then sixty years later. What is the subjective experience? From a naive counting perspective, I should predict that I would be nearly certainly teleported in time to some distant future point, because the number of future copies of my present state is vastly greater than the two present copies. On the other hand, the total number of observers descended from the current duplicates will always outnumber the observers descended from the future duplicates. So perhaps the right counting is by the number of descendents at each time slice, rather than by the total number of descendents of my present state. Even worse, how can my subjective experience change depending on whether somebody millions of years in the future turns off the darned duplicator? (Boltzmann's brain is a similar idea).  """

Gold was found in California w/early explorers along Colorado River & near Mexican era Los Angeles in 1832 so existence of gold only confirmed not discovered in 1848 although the find was reason for the 1849 Rush, the latter the unique part of incident. To say that gold was discovered in California in 1848 is an ethnocentric statement as well as an example of ignorance by those that either do not want to acknowledge that gold had already been verified as being in California therefore it cannot be a discovery. Finding more gold is not a discovery but a re-confirmation of the existence of gold in the area.66.74.176.59  """

Armenians got encourge with Russia and France, These countries came and help them. Armenian gangs mostly  were foreign and encouraged the local Armenians. It became a civil war. Armenians and Turkish groups were attacking each other. If you were the decision maker, how would you stop this? Answer is reallocation. The only solution was reallocation. I am not saying old woman and childeren were supposed to immigrate but you can not know who supports Armenians gangs, right?...  'disorganized revenge killings' happened at both side.

(2)  The Quackbuster manipulation of Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia: 

Wikipedia is an odd thing.  It is made up of a so-called """"volunteer system.""""  Several years ago, a team of quackbusters infiltrated various levels of the Wikipedia operation, and are now entrenched in the middle, and lower, level volunteer management system.  If you try and put any positive information about advanced medicine, or the problems of US health care, on Wikipedia, or change false or misleading information the quackbusters have installed, you will fail.  You will be blocked from further """"editing"""" and the pages of Wikipedia will now carry information about what a """"terrible person you are.""""  The only way to have ANY influence over what Wikipedia says about  subject is to approach them with a legal threat letter at the highest levels.  Nothing else works.  Even that has problems, for Wikipedia management operates on a financial shoestring, and apparently has no ability to police its own encyclopedia.  Unfortunately, people use the encyclopedia - and they get very bad information about health care.

Below is a paragraph from the editor’s section of Wikipedia.  The editor, here, is discussing the problem of the quackbuster slime, acting to control the information flow on Wikipedia - and what to do about it.  so you understand the abbreviation POV stand for Point of View, and NPOV stands for No Point of View, which Wikipedia wants.  The part in red is for emphasis. Read this:

I guess it depends on what purpose the External Links section serves. Do the links have to serve the NPOV interests of the article or can the links section be a place where specific points-of-view can have a chance to be expressed? As it is now, the chiropractic link section is broken down into Advocacy and Critiques. I think that this warns the researcher that they are leaving the NPOV environment that Wikipedia tries to provide and will be entering a POV external site.

If these links are truly just linking to the page for marketing reasons and don't serve a primary function of adding to the knowledge-base, I would then say to axe them. I haven't checked every critical link, but they do seem to link to essays or research on pages that don't directly try to sell you anything (other than their POV). If they are all offering the same POV with no really distinguishing differences, then they should be reduced in number.

The soapbox point is interesting. These are external links so it would seem that Wikipedia is not being directly exploited as a soapbox. However, the abundance of critical links could be seen as an attempt to present bias... using the amount of negative criticisms to invoke a negative POV about chiropractic. My solution up until now has been to add to the advocacy links to balance out the criticism. You can certainly try to delete the critical links and claim NPOV but I can almost guarantee you that you be quickly (and improperly) accused of """"vandalism"""" by one of three specific chiroskeptics who police the chiropractic page all day long as far as I can tell. They love to throw """"vandalism"""" accusations around - and usually are vastly overstating the matter. That being said, I have suggested a """"disarming"""" strategy, where both sides would remove links in a balanced way, but my suggestion was met with silence.

Now as far as the link farming goes. Yes, virtually all of the critical sites are linked together through the SkepticRing, Anti-Quackery Ring, Chiropractic Subluxated Ring and other ways fashioned specifically for the purpose of boosting Search Engine ranking. A lot of those sites are operated by Stephen Barrett and his buddy Sammy Homola - Chirobase.org, Quackwatch.org, and NCAHF. They're three organizations all saying the same thing. What's really slimy is that they state opinions then reference their sister-sites support to that opinion. A lot of the links are operated or moderated by Fyslee (one of the three chiroskepics users who regularly accuse people of vandalism for removing links to his sites). Check out his userpage to see which sites he operates and moderates for. These chiroskepitics are working together to actively employ search engine tricks such as artifically boosting Google ranking by adding external links to their sites all over Wikipedia. I have documented this. Their goal is for a researcher curious about chiropractic to encounter their anti-chiropractic sites first on a Google search. Given these organizations' objective, I can certainly understand why they would want to do this. Unfortunately, the tactics that they employ are objectionable to both Google and Wikipedia. Hopefully these organizations will get wise to the chiroskeptic ring and ban their sites.

I'm not sure what to do in the meantime. One thing that I would like to suggest is that a website is linked to only once in the external links section. As"

It said that Korea was illegally claiming the land. That is not true. I agree that older historical evidence is being ignored from the Korean side. They need a mediator because each country and government is out to persue their own agenda. CIA World Factbook is calling them the Liancourt Rocks. I don't like either government very much. The sad thing is, the Japanese Educational System is teaching that the island is Takeshima and is Japan's with no hard evidence.

childhood is like a lock without a key
its the blooming time for brainwash
and explanation of what you see
growing up and burning up inside
do your chores, go to bed
put a bullet through yer head

kill yer parents / burn their bodies 
bury the ashes / find out what you want

going mad and maturing all along
yer parents are fucking blind
and their ideals are all wrong
influenced by what your parents always want
you're a model of their youth
you're a trophy they can flaunt

kill yer parents / burn their bodies
bury the ashes / find out what you want

kill yer parents / the voices in yer head 
EV-O-LU-TION / freedom lies ahead

now you're sick and dying too
all alone in a black lifeless room
with nothing to do
death, it doesn't seem to phase me
but people crying over dying never ceases to amaze me

1317,"""A few ideas to balance the US centric style.

Whilst you have brought in large area of British (mainly English and Welsh) facts neverthe less the opening paragraphs are somewhat US based.  I have no knowledge whatsoever on anything other than the UK perspective (though as this contributes significantly to US law, it will at least set some history.  

I am also a little bit concerned at why juries were created in the first place, you state that this is because they are believed to be free from bribery. Historically, trial by jury arose because of the difficulties of securing trial by ordeal, due to a change in church law.  By that time juries already sat to decide if there was a primae facie case to answer (the modern equivalent being Grand Juries).

The history of trial by jury (in England and hence the US) is related to several important events, most notebly the Assizes of Clarendon, the Fourth Lantern Council and the Magna Carta.

It may be useful for you to have a look at some of the wikipedia sites listed below:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_ordeal

""""In the Assize of Clarendon, enacted in 1166 and the first great legislative act in the reign of the English Angevin King Henry II, the law of the land required that: """"anyone, who shall be found, on the oath of the aforesaid [a jury], to be accused or notoriously suspect of having been a robber or murderer or thief, or a receiver of them ... be taken and put to the ordeal of water.""""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Lateran_Council

Canons 14-18. Rules on the conduct of the clergy including against such things as: non-celibate living, drunkenness, frequenting taverns, hunting, conducting trials by ordeal or combat 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta

Though you may be best considering the uk statute site which says:
http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1517519

""""NO Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor [X5 condemn him,] but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land.""""

The film had me yawning all the way through and I genuinely had to check myself several times from shutting off for a kip! Never a bright moment, nothing to lift the mood, even the silly cameos in it. It's not that the film, the scenery or whatever is bog standard or dreadful, but its the way the scene are compiled and the lifelessness of the actors in it which make it exceedingly dull and uninspiring to watch. David Lean was apparently an uncredited assistant director on it which I find hard to believe. Uncredited perhaps because of sheer embarrassment with the result.

@Drmies: First of all I want to appoligy for my too hasty re-inclusion of the content into the article, which I by the way only did because of the presumption of having satisfied all fellow editors call for adding a direct reference for the """"Reference values in the table"""", which previously indeed lacked a reference. In the back-mirror, I was a little too hasty to re-instate and should of course instead first have uploaded the content to my sandbox, and then asked for the talkpage approval before uploading it again. Please however consider, that all my actions were only excecuted in good faith. Subsequently I was surprised to find a continued resistance about the content from fellow editors here at the talkpage. Based on those grounds, I of course accept your removal of the content from the article, and have just created a  for the subsequent debate we shall now still continue to have, about the appropriateness (which I still claim) to include a monthly data table in the article.

In regards of your claim that my most recent version of the uploaded disputed material is still WP:OR, I will request you to return with a reply why you think this is so, and what we in your opinion need to do in order for the content to satisfy the policy. As far as I know, we are allowed at Wikipedia to create our own wikitables to display fully referenced data, which it indeed was in my latest version of the data table. I admit at first to have uploaded unsourced """"Monthly reference value data"""" that strived against WP:OR, which was something I only did as part of a process, in the hope for other editors (or myself) at a later stage being able to find direct sources for those values. Yesterday, I indeed managed to find a direct source for these monthly values published by the Polish Ministry of Finance. Please take into consideration, that we do not have 2 equal WP:PS for the same data but only have 1 (The Polish source), as I have managed to proof here at the talkpage that the Latvian source do not qualify for the purpose, as it did not strictly follow the published official """"ECB evaluation method"""" (which it by the way funny enough also never claimed it did) - but instead has adopted its own data approach. Please also consider, that my uploaded data table with monthly data in principle can stand alone, even without that we mention the debated report by the """"Latvian Central Bank"""", as I have prooved here at the talkpage they utilised another data approach than the official """"ECB method"""". After I now have ellaborated on the details, do you then have a different opinion whether or not my most recent version of the uploaded material still shall be classified as WP:OR?

The reason why I think it is so important that we in the Latvian article display monthly convergence values for each month for the past year, and why inclusion of this material shall not be disquallified as per WP:NOTSTATS, is because the uploaded monthly data (for the most recent 12 months) reflect how the official """"ECB method"""" works, as a graphical illustration which help casual readers to grasp that all candidate countrys have been granted the right by EU to apply ECB for conducting a monthly convergence check at each month during the year (if they belief to have met all criteria). Unfortunately ECB do not automatically publish monthly convergency reports during the year (because in that case we would obviously have used their direct data for the table instead). But as I already provided evidense for, the Polish Ministry are publishing monthly reports where they check for monthly convergence and calculate the ECB reference value limits based on the official """"ECB method"""" (which proofs this is notable stuff), and their findings in the Polish context has also been covered over at the Polish wikipedia (although by a much lower quality than my attempt). Taking this into consideration, will you then still argue it is inappropriate we do the same here at the English wikipedia for the Latvian article (in the version showcased by my )?   

Personal reply to TDL (not related to the article itself)
@TDL: In the past four months there have now been a few times, where you and I clashed about the WP:OR policy. In those cases where we have clashed, I admit to have applied a backwords approach, where I started out to state the facts as I knew it was the WP:TRUTH. I have always seen such uploads as part of a process, where we were continously working to find sources and improve the articles. So my uploads were not ment to be unsourced forever, but something where it could be possible for me (or another editor) at a later stage to return and add the needed"

From the main article about Hugo Chavez:

Chávez was raised a Roman Catholic, although he has had a series of disputes with both the Venezuelan Catholic hierarchy and Protestant groups like the New Tribes Mission. He has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, but over the course of his presidency, Chávez has become increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his interpretation of Jesus' personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his left-wing and progressivist views. He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro's health.

I find it ironic that an atheist such as Hugo Chavez would ask the Venezuelan people to pray to God for another atheist's (Fidel Castro) health! This just shows what a hypocrite and liar Chavez is!"

 Kitzinger 

Regards reference 46, Framing abuse by Kitzinger, I got the book out of the library yesterday.  In the index, and on a brief flip through there is no mention of satan, satanic abuse, ritual abuse, the United States, religion, religious leaders, the satanic panic, courts, judicial systems, guilt, or anything else that really supports the sentence """"In America and Britain journalists framed the charges against the defendants as evidence of a moral panic and mass hysteria; child protection workers and social workers involved were bound by their professional codes of confidentiality and unable to comment on the specifics of the cases""""  There is focus on two cases - Cleveland and Orkney, both in the UK.  Based on my reading, the main focus of the book is on how the media's portrayal of the cases affected the public's perception of the event years later - not on guilt or innocence (though there is discussion on how the media left out and selectively reported details that were more convincing of the guilt of the parents.  If anyone on this talk page has read the book or is responsible for placing the text on the page, could you refer me to the page number (and chapter in case we have different versions) so I can verify?  Right now I'm tempted to excise the statement for having a) nothing to do with the U.S. b) nothing to do with the outcome of court cases and c) nothing to do with satanic ritual abuse.  If nothing else, it would allow the most nuanced, hopefully most neutral, portrayal of the book's contents.  Kitzinger appears to be very carefully saying nothing about the suspects' guilt or innocence, but I admit it is a cursory flip-through.  Got some other scholarly books from the same section in the library, some of which discuss SRA specifically, hopefully I'll find time to read them.    """

A trio of LDS scholars have been funded by the LDS church to write a book, Tragedy at Mountain Meadows, to be published by the Oxford University Press:

Ronald W. Walker (BYU Professor of History), 
Richard E. Turley Jr. (managing director of the Family and Church History Department of the Church), and Glen M. Leonard (director of the Church's Museum of Church History and Art). 

The three were granted access to documents in the LDS Church archives. According to Turley, a file in the archives confirms that Lee was acting on his own. The file included the notes of a Mormon historian who, at the request of Church leaders, conducted a confidential investigation of the massacre in 1892. Turley said, """"There are very candid statements on the part of participants to a Church official under the agreement of confidentiality.""""

While the trio found additional evidence of church leaders' culpability, Turley stated that """"Utahns elsewhere in the territory acted to preserve the lives of other troublesome immigrants . . . Unfortunately, the militia and church leaders of Iron County made different decisions, and their acts demand the strongest condemnation . . . Circumstance may explain their acts; nothing can justify them.""""

The new sources the co-authors are using will be made public once their book is published. Turley said although the church is cooperating and is funding the research, the work is """"not a Church commission""""; """"The idea to do the book was ours, not theirs."""" Publication apparently has been delayed as the co-authors have tried to be as thorough in their research as possible. According to Turley, LDS leaders share the authors' desire to bring all available evidence out in the open. First drafts of the book will be circulated for comment among LDS and non-LDS parties, including historians and descendants of the perpetrators and victims. """"Open, candid evaluation of that tragedy can produce catharsis, a cleansing spiritual renewal and healing,"""" Turley said, adding that the authors will """"present the evidence as we find it - honestly, openly and candidly.""""

whatever....I did NOT say I would edit war, in fact I said I would be careful NOT actually edit war, but to simply place a word that belongs in the article, that Nova keeps having issues with.   Are you saying that I don't have the right in the """"future"""" to ever put in anything simply cuz Nova would object?     My hands would have to be tied, you're saying??

I don't like how you jumped the gun and twisted what I said around, where I specifically said I would NOT """"edit war"""", but would not put up with suppression of facts, simply cuz Nova doesn't like them. Also, the """"personal attacks"""" are merely facts about this individual that can be easily looked up. I'm not the only one who doesn't like him or what he does.    Actually at this point I don't care...I'm tired of the insanity.....I have other things to do, and this nonsense is too time-consuming anyway.  For real.   This person Nova made it """"personal"""" long before I did, with his actions.    Again, there are others who feel the same way....  I'm not the only one he's upset with his constant edit warring and disrespect.  So you looking only at me, and misunderstanding my words and my intent.    I was seriously planning to be done with Wikipedia for a long while anyway. (I have other accounts and even other IPs anyway.....but I probably won't even use them, as I don't really care to be wasting time on this stuff, anymore.)  Nova has no business on Wikipedia. He's an insufferable joke.  And I don't care that it's a personal attack. Since I'm blocked anyway, I might as well make it worth it.   He should just get lost from all articles, he adds nothing but aggravation and a barrage of insanity.    

Again, I'm NOT the only one who's been a victim of his crazy nonsense.    Yet that nutball stays unblocked, yet he is the CAUSE of it all the problems.    Interesting.  As I said, whatever.....I contributed a lot to WP in 5 short months (my first edit in Feb 2008 does not count, as that was just playing around....I got serious with WP in February 2010....)....with meaningful additions, corrections, source editing, vandalism removal, grammar correction, section adding, creation of a few articles.....etc.   I never even intended to get into this, it was all an accident when I couldn't find some topics on WP that I thought would be, so I decided to create some articles....and then get caught up in this stuff.   Much to my chagrin.   I have better (for real) things to do.    I don't care that much that I'm blocked......but it's the principle that it's sort of unfair, and you misunderstand (and actually twisted) my words around.....and this maniac (more personal attacks, so I'm making it good) gets off basically scott-free.......EVEN THOUGH I CAN SHOW YOU EXAMPLES OF WHERE HE'S BEEN AN INSUFFERABLE TARD WITH OTHER PEOPLE TOO.    You'll overlook that of course.     Cuz Nova knows how to manipulate WP and WP Admins fairly well, I've noticed.    Though I know that some Admins see his nonsense too.    

Anyway, again.....to re-iterate.....I did not say I would """"edit war"""" but would simply exercise my rights to put in words in an article, despite Nova's own constant edit warring and neurotic objections to everything.    And I said I would be careful NOT to violate 3RR as well as NOT brazenly """"edit war"""".     Of course you see it as a threat to """"edit war"""" anyway...  Me simply saying I will not stand for whole words to be removed, even if they're accurate, simply because ONE editor does not like it.    """

1871,"Red Peacock - You are correct to think something is amiss. Xeno apparently only saw that portion of the interview in which Susan actively argues with the insane man holding the hitler picture (as if that alone wasn't unprofessional). Apparently he didn't catch her arguing fervently with the suburban dad (discussed at length in the article) on behalf of Obama.  And, perhaps most importantly, he clearly didn’t catch how Susan treated individuals who accused Bush of being Hitler just several years ago.[] Obviously I don’t intend for that video to go up in the article, but I include it to demonstrate that Xeno’s Hitler-related argument is, to be charitable, a laughing matter. By the way, RedPeacock. If you ever want something REALLY entertaining to do, I would suggest going to the Keith Olbermann article and looking at the now-infamous “criticism” section in the talk page. A few conservatives were able to play on the Olbermann-worshipers’ intense devotion to him by getting them to go to such great depths to prevent inclusion into the article that it is not possible to read it without wondering if it’s all just a big joke. Seriously – it’s really long but well worth the read.

NOTE that these new Google webquests are not related to the older original webquests at all, and do NOT superced them in any manner. ONE person comes along who has created a new site that provides help ONLY for the NEW Google webquests (and no help whatsoever with the older original webquests), and this prat deletes ALL the links and information to ALL the webquest help sites both old and new, and replaces them with his own link, and when several site owners try to put their information back up, this clown repeatedly deletes it ..and then you mods back him up??? WTF is up with that??? PLEASE EXPLAIN YOUR ACTIONS??? Your page now provides absolutely no links to help with the original webquests, and only one link for help with the new webquest, which is all thanks to this one selfish prat from googlefact.blogspot.com. Oh wait, there's one more link too, and that's to his mirror site at davinciquest.blogspot.com. How can you justify your actions? The owner of googlefact.blogspot.com also posted on the site of one of the links he removed (student-rant.blogspot.com), to laugh at everyone and thank us all for the traffic and the ad-impression revenue it is generating for him. AND THIS IS WHAT YOU PEOPLE SEEM TO CONDONE???? If you could give some reason for your actions then perhaps all of us site owners who were deleted could understand, but we do not see that there is any justification for what you have done, nor has anyone offered any. The ONLY message we're getting here is that it pays to manipulate Wikipedia for personal gain and delete everyone else's links but your own. WE HUMBLY REQUEST YOU RECTIFY THIS MATTER AND THEN LOCK THE PAGE TO STOP THE PERSON WHO STARTED ALL THIS FROM DOING IT AGAIN - which happens to be the one link you have left on the page. At a bare minimum, restore the help links to the original webquests so people looking for help with them can actually get some. I still can't believe how unjustly you mods have administered this matter so far."

================================
These are prior comments from earlier this year (2011) that were ignored:

1. Wikipedia Elective surgery states: """"Elective surgery is surgery that is scheduled in advance because it does not involve a medical emergency. Semi-elective surgery is a surgery that must be done to preserve the patient's life, but does not need to be performed immediately.""""

2. Medicinenet.com defines the term Elective surgery as follows: """"Surgery that is subject to choice (election)...As opposed to urgent or emergency surgery."""" []

3. Medicinenet.com defines the term Elective as follows: """"In medicine, something chosen (elected). An elective procedure is one that is chosen (elected) by the patient or physician that is advantageous to the patient but is not urgent. Elective surgery is decided by the patient or their doctor. The procedure is seen as beneficial but not absolutely essential at that time."""" []

4. Wikipedia Surgery states: """"Types of surgery: Surgical procedures are the commonly categorized by urgency, type of procedure, body system involved, degree of invasiveness, and special instrumentation. Based on timing: Elective surgery is done to correct a non-life-threatening condition, and is carried out at the patient's request, subject to the surgeon's and the surgical facility's availability. Emergency surgery is surgery which must be done promptly to save life, limb, or functional capacity. A semi-elective surgery is one that must be done to avoid permanent disability or death, but can be postponed for a short time. Based on purpose: Exploratory surgery is performed to aid or confirm a diagnosis. Therapeutic surgery treats a previously diagnosed condition.""""

Thus a reasonable person would conclude that non-emergency therapeutic surgery is a subcategory of elective surgery. Nearly all surgical abortions are NOT emergency procedures (in other words, they are scheduled procedures and are not medical emergencies).      

It seems that this Abortion article's inartful use of the terms """"elective"""" and """"therapeutic"""" confuses the reader rather than clarifying important distinctions. One would use """"elective"""" to describe a procedure based on the timing of the surgery. One would use the term """"therapeutic"""" to describe a procedure based on whether there has been a diagnosis.  The 2 terms are not mutually exclusive.  

If the terms """"elective"""" and """"therapeutic"""" are to be applied consistently (with no politically correct definitions for procedures performed on pregnant women), then virtually all therapeutic abortions are also elective procedures. Practically speaking, in nearly all modern situataions the 2 terms will be mutually inclusive because modern medicine considers the satisfaction of any woman's desire to no longer be pregnant (regardless of the reason why she no longer wants to be pregnant) as """"therapeutic"""", and abortion is virtually NEVER performed under emergency conditions (in other words: there are virtually no occurences in which an abortion must be done immediately to avoid a serious health risk).   

The current section of this article called """"Induced"""" [] contains a false dichotomy when it states: """"Reasons for procuring induced abortions are typically characterized as either therapeutic or elective. An abortion is medically referred to as a therapeutic abortion when it is performed to: ... An abortion is referred to as elective when it is performed at the request of the woman """"for reasons other than maternal health or fetal disease."""". 

This false dichotomy should be corrected by helping the reader understand that the 2 terms therapeutic and elective are virtually synonymous, rather than leading the reader to incorrectly think that an abortion is EITHER elective OR therapeutic. Rarely will any therapeutic abortion not also be elective.  

Finally, using the term """"therapeutic"""" also implies that the condition of being pregnant is a disease or a health defect, when in reality, absent any political use of medical terminology, pregnancy is a sign of a healthy reproductive system and is never a disease. There are extremely rare occassions when organs of or near the reproductive tract are diseased and an abortion could thus be therepeutic to the gravid woman (though fatal to the fetus). 

Perhaps this wording would address these concerns:

'''An induced abortion is almost always both elective and therapeutic, meaning that it is a non-em"

The link you provide states that """"45% of the rail market in Sweden is privatised"""" that therefore makes saying """"Rail transport in Sweden is privatised"""" a falsification if more than half of the entire market is still owned by the government. It doesn't matter whether the rail market was """"liberalised"""" into different companies under state ownership e.g. SJ, something cannot be described as """"privatised"""" if it retains a majority of government ownership, because it is therefore nationalised, the opposite of privatisation. To describe the Swedish rail market as privatised and then list a state owned company which comprises it in the very same sentence is nonsense and this is exactly what you have written.

""""Rail transport market is privatized and companies include SJ.........."""" - In this sentence you have made it sound as if SJ is a private company which is untrue, since if the person reading clicks the SJ hyperlink, they will be taken to an article which states unambiguously that SJ is a government owned enterprise.

A much better thing to do would be to explain that the majority of passenger transport by rail in Sweden is operated by state owned companies such as SJ as well as the government run Lokal Trafik in place within each of Sweden's Län such as HallandsTrafik, Storstockholms Lokaltrafik, SkåneTrafik etc. etc. etc. and THEN to explain that some sectors of rail transport are privatised such as the transport of cargo. This would therefore align the content of the article with the reference you presented above, which states that the majority of rail transport in Sweden is still government owned (with 45% being privatised).

Since judging by your other edits you are a right winger with a serious beef against anything government owned, you could then satisfy yourself by writing that state owned SJ isn't the most efficient of rail networks, something which a lot of Swedes themselves agree on as far as I have seen. In my own experience delays are common and travelling with SJ can be expensive.

International Reactions

On September 19, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov vowed to work for the release of the medics on his trip to Libya in November. novinite. U.S. President George W. Bush has said """"I want them free."""" One of Gaddafi's sons has admitted at least some Libyan responsibility. On December 24, 2005, it was announced that Libya, Bulgaria, the EU, and the US had agreed on a fund which may help to resolve the matter. Reuters. Yahoo!

In response to the risk of a new death penalty verdict in the current trial, international opinion has again began to mobilize. In October 2006, several scientific organizations responded with appeals, and The New York Times NY Times. and the journal Nature Nature. published strong editorials calling for a fair trial.

Quid pro quo
Although he concurred with the guilty verdict, Gaddafi proposed releasing the six medics, if quid pro quo:
the convicted Pan Am Flight 103 bomber Megrahi, serving a life sentence in a Scottish jail, were to be released; and
US$2.7 billion compensation were paid to Libya for the care of the HIV-infected patients (the exact sum offered by Libya in compensation for the 270 lives lost in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing).http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=57381
Bulgaria refused to pay any compensation on the grounds that it would be admitting the guilt of the medics. On June 7, 2005, the European Union engaged in negotiations to provide assistance to Libya, but not directly linked to the case of the six medics.http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=57040 On August 18, 2005, Libya recommended that Bulgaria should negotiate on the amount of the payment.http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory?id=1048104&CMP;=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 The next week, the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) delegate visited Libya and saw the medics.http://www.novinite.com/newsletter/print.php?id=51534 On August 31, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin stated that Bulgaria would send humanitarian aid while not acknowledging the guilt of the medics.http://www.focus-fen.net/index.php?catid=72&ch;=0&newsid;=71374http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?idCategory=33&idsub;=124&id;=1823 On September 8, it was announced that Libya had prepared a list of 40 items (non-monetary) that should be sent as aid and that Bulgaria could supply 24 of them.http://www.focus-fen.net/index.php?focus=hot&hotid;=758

On December 25, 2005, Libya's supreme court overturned death sentences against the Benghazi Six, who had always denied intentionally infecting 426 children with HIV-contaminated blood. 

Bulgarian president Georgi Parvanov said the court ruling """"confirmed our hope that justice in this case will prevail."""" President Parvanov added: """"The unfair death sentences were reversed. …We hope that the swiftness and the effectiveness demonstrated by the Libyan court in the past days will help solve the case as soon as possible.""""

US State Department spokesman, Justin Higgins, described the decision as a """"positive development since it removes the risk of the death penalty being carried out. As we have made clear before, we believe a way should be found to allow the medics to return to their home"""".

The Council of Europe welcomed the decision and said it hoped the new trial will """"comply with the internationally recognised standards of fairnes"

    obsolete English handicap, a game in which forfeit money was held in a cap, from hand in cap"""", which obviously has nothing at all to do with being """"Handy with a cap"""" or even related to the disabled. Certain individuals may have a negative connotation with the use of the term, which happens merely due to the words close association with 1960's era community welfare practices, but that is an individuals choice to associate negativity with the word, not the words fault at all.

There seems to be some general confusion about the pronunciation of the Roosevelts' name, even within the FDR article.  I've tried to find a few reliable sources for this info.

M-W gives:
Main Entry:
    Roo·se·velt
Pronunciation:
    \ˈrō-zə-vəlt (Roosevelts' usual pron.), -ˌvelt also ˈrü-\
Dictionary.com gives:
Roo·se·velt  /ˈroʊzəˌvɛlt, -vəlt, ˈroʊzvɛlt, -vəlt; spelling pron. ˈruzəˌvɛlt/
Inogolo gives this about Teddy's name:
Name: Roosevelt  Phonetic Pronunciation: ROAZ-uh-velt
Notes: There has been much debate about the correct pronunciation of Roosevelt's last name, however, in several letters Theodore Roosevelt himself specifies the correct pronunciation. In a letter to the Rev. William W. Moir dated October 10, 1898 he writes:
As for my name, it is pronounced as if it was spelled """"Rosavelt."""" That is in three syllables. The first syllable as if it was """"Rose.""""
Note that none of these sources make a distinction between Teddy and FDR, despite the claims of some that they preferred different pronunciations.  At the very least, each article should be internally consistent.  For Teddy, it seems to be clear that it's /ˈɹoʊzəvɛlt/.  His statement above makes that pretty clear.  FDR's case doesn't seem to be as unequivocal, but the same pronunciation seems to be the preferred one in most media.  The most common variant seems to be the barely noticeably different /ˈɹoʊzəvəlt/.  Most seem to cite the preferred pronunciation of the name being three syllables, not two.

I found a BBC article (see this link) that states
Constantine founded a new city named after himself: Constantinople. Christian writers played up the idea that this was to be a 'new Rome', a fitting Christian capital for a newly Christian empire.

But they had to find ways to explain the embarrassing fact that in this new, supposedly Christian city, Constantine had erected pagan temples and statues.

then move on to basics. keep the bitcoin protocol details out of the article since you already split off the page about the protocol. the shortest description Ive read is: """"When a transaction is broadcast to the network, it is relayed with a digital fingerprint that identifies it. Bitcoin miners scoop it up, verify it, and send it on to the rest of the network for confirmation.

Mangled Units of Transmission Speed
Can anyone explain what units CuteFTP uses for """"Speed"""" - I see """"kbs"""" and """"mbs"""" in the CuteFTP 8 """"Queue Window"""" for example, but these are not valid units.  """"kbs"""" suggests """"kilo-byte seconds"""" or """"kilo-bit seconds"""" ... but both are nonsense units (should be either kbps or kb/s).  Similarly, """"mbs"""" suggests """"milli-byte seconds"""" or """"milli-bit seconds"""" which is doubly nonsense - both because it is a nonsense unit and also because (even if they mean mbps or mb/s) it is a ridiculously small unit.  I realize that they probably mean """"Mega"""" rather than """"milli"""" - but then they should use capital """"M"""".

""""Baud"""" used to be used universally for data transmission rates, and that is, at least, unambiguous.

Since the vista article contains information about the anti trust situation which, since it seems some people here have got a mouthful of gate's balls, is mislabelled anti trust controversy. Not really a controversy though is it when a court elected by over two hundred million people issues a decision, it'a court ruling, like it or not there's no controversy too that. Otherwise we should renaim the ted bundy trial, to the tend bundy controversy, since any court ruling merits this label. 

Since there's a section on anti trust laws and vista, it's worth noting the recent news that microsoft are going to be paying a hefty daily fine for completely ignoring the court's injuction. And this does have bearing on vista. You can't quote the m.s. pr saying we don't know what they want us to do, it's all questions, or whatever else he mentioned, without an adjunct sentence, of the head official regulating the anti trust actions quoting him too saying that our injuctions are crystal clear yet ms has ignored them for over two years now. 

But of course this has no bearing if this article is supposed to be a showcase for vista.

If you want to use the Krugman link, keep in mind it says Obama is in danger of becoming one, while saying Bush was one. It is also an opinion piece. Depending on how far one wants to stretch the definition of CoP, we could include most of the examples listed above, as well as Reagan and potentially GWB (before his approval ratings tanked). Hell, we could even mention Martin Luther King. But there is an enormous difference between them and Kim Jung Il or Fidel Castro. 

There is no doubt Obama has some over-zealous fans. Many do, including Ron Paul and Sarah Palin, though admittedly some of Obamas are substantially more so. What is useless to the article is anecdotal evidence such as a group of kids singing a song or some guy who made some Obama votives. As for singing, one should keep in mind that for many years candidates would have campaign songs written about them, naming them specifically, so a song about Obama is really nothing new. (Recently the trend has been to adopt pop songs from the 60s and 70s, but that isn't a rule.) Most importantly, he distinction must be made between what happens during a regime and what happens during a campaign. In any presidential campaign emotions are running high, and both sides are actively promoting themselves as much as possible, with signs and images everywhere. Campaigns have become bigger, more expensive, more promotional, and more partisan over the last couple decades. This is not necessarily indicative of the situation when the campaign is over. There is a difference between charisma or popularity and a cult of personality. -"

 Explanation 

Dear EDJohnston and Bearian, I am not here to harm any one or to put any unnecessary information in Wikipedia pages.
Here in UST Global wikipedia page I update the latest information regarding UST Gloabal so that wikipedia users get the right information under right category.

1) Under Corporate Milestones: Company achievements needs to be listed.
2) The link http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4298931 may have the recent major information about UST Global, but the top part of the page that mentions about """"Key Executives"""" is totally wrong. Two people and their postions who are not part of UST Global is being mentioned here.
3) UST Global is a Company where in past there may have a lot of people who were part of this company in key roles/posts (during their asscociation with the company their names may have been part of this Company related records), but once they left this company searching for other oppurtunities i dont understand why they want to mention their name associated with UST Global. This is like self advertisement which is totally against wikipedia policy

Please advice me if i am wrong in my understanding.

Thank you,
Chellappa.M

Hi !

That's why I asked on the talk-page if the mentioned sources (court-documents and atleast two primary accounts) are sufficient that the allegations should be mentioned. It is tricky to ask such a question without saying what the allegations -are-. I absolutely agree that just because someone claimed something in a court-filing, that's not evidence that something is true. But it -IS- evidence that you have been accused of it. 

On the balance I think I agree with you. One can be accused of anything, by anyone, afterall.

My question was asked in good faith. The accusations (which I won't repeat here) do show up high in controversies about the man, second only, I think, to the conflicts with scientology."

Somewhat earlier  correctly observed that """"a citation for that formal definition of equality with domain but not codomain could be useful in that discussion"""".  The citation I gave is from Tom Apostol Calculus, page 54, but this is rather old.  Looking in recent literature was very instructive.  The problem is that definitions of function equality in the literature seem rare somehow (not found in about a dozen of recent math and CS books where such a definition could be expected).  Googling on """"function equality"""" or """"equal functions"""" was equally ineffective, but """"functions f and g are equal"""" yields many results (mostly lecture notes).  Some definitions of function equality include codomain equality, some do not. Here are a few that do not include codomain equality, as requested:

http://solitaryroad.com/c303.html
 http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs103/handouts/25%20Functions.pdf
 http://www.bus.ucf.edu/sgerking/ECO%203401/Chapter%202.ppt
 http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~wcherowi/courses/m3000/lecture8a.pdf
 http://www.cse.unl.edu/~cse235/files/Functions.ppt

An interesting subtlety: many of the latter group define a codomain, but do not include it in the definition of function equality.  As Leibniz would say, this means that they do not really consider the codomain as part of the definition of a function.  More subtle: some talk about """"the domain of f"""" but about """"the codomain"""" (without """"of f"""").

A pragmatic observation: authors including a codomain (say Y) in the definition of a function seem to do very little with it, except (i) defining when a function is """"onto"""" instead of """"onto Y"""", (ii) allowing it to restrict flexibility in the way functions can be combined, for instance, by composition.

In Wikipedia film articles I've come across ridiculous, tiny detail by detail plot synopses from beginning right through to the very end. And, yes, that's 'allowable', but can be very annoying to many. The problem further is that then there may be no real in depth discussion of the film beyond giving the structure of the plot away, leaving a shallow, spoiling article.

So I was a bit relieved to find the current Norwegian Wood synopsis.  It doesn't seem to have been suggested much, though ideal would be for films to have a separate full plot Wikipedia page, containing the full synopses first also. It would leave it possible for people who haven't seen a film to read the main film article page without having to learn of what happens through to the end.

Anyway, ideally, I agree with 1ragincajun. Isn't it possible to be a bit more vague about the development, including something like - 'the hero's life develops with these 2 love interests in an emotionally tight film involving tragedy'? Just a thought."

27611,"""With over 100,000 college students studying abroad every year, there's bound to be all kinds of tall tales, urban legends, and misinformation swirling around.  While there may be grains of truth in some of these stories, below are some common misconceptions about study abroad.

Misconception #1: Studying abroad is very expensive.

Truth: In most cases, it is actually cheaper to study abroad.  Let's say the tuition at your school is $5,000 per semester and room and board is another $4,000.  Now add in the additional fees you have such as health insurance, books, and laundry.  You are now well over $10,000 for the semester.  Well, all but one of our programs in Spain is under $10,000 per semester and that includes everything except your airfare and spending money.
TAB

Misconception #2: I can't use my financial aid to study abroad.

Truth: In almost all cases, your federal aid (Stafford loans, Pell grants, etc.) can be used to study abroad and in some states, you can use your state aid as well.  It is also not uncommon for your federal aid to increase when you study abroad since some of your school scholarships may not transfer.

Misconception #3: Host families are all poor and just do it for the money.

Truth: The last thing any study abroad company wants to do is have an unhappy student on their program.  The goal is for the students to be happy so that they will tell their friends what a great time they had.  If we were putting students in bad families, in dangerous neighborhoods, then no one would ever recommend us to their friends.  Since the number of universities that endorse our program doubled over the last year, it's a pretty sure bet that students are happy with our choice of families. 

Misconception #4: I'll be so busy with schoolwork that I won't get time to see the country I'm in.

Truth: This one is hysterically funny since your average study abroad student comes home with about 400+ photos from a long list of countries.  Students have plenty of opportunities to travel and we even take our students on trips to give them a better feel for the country they are in.

Misconception #5: I might not graduate on time if I go abroad.

Truth: If you have already used up all of your elective or general education courses, then it's true that you might need to bulk up on courses before or after you go abroad.  If you plan ahead, however, and leave some electives open to you, then you should be fine.  The clear majority of students who study abroad still graduate in four years, despite being away from their home campus for a semester or two.

Misconception #6: Most of the world hates Americans, so I won't be safe.

Truth: There's no doubt that there are a lot of people who don't like the American government, but that has nothing to do with the American people.  If you compare the violent crime rate in the United States to that of European, Australian, or Asian countries, you will see that the United States is actually far more dangerous.  There are some areas of South America and Africa that are not especially safe, but there are also many countries on those continents that are incredibly safe.  Go to the U.S. State Department website and check out the crime statistics on the country you are interested in to see how safe it is.

Studying abroad is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that every college student should take advantage of.  Before dismissing it due to the bad experience of one friend or rumors you have had heard, speak with your study abroad advisor and get the facts.  I guarantee that once you look at all that studying abroad can offer you, you'll be hopping the first flight abroad.

One organization that help ensure that you have safest, unforgettable yet affordable study abroad experience is Academic Studies Abroad.    Here are some of our very popular study abroad programsin the following countries:

-Study Abroad Spain- Academic Studies offers study abroad programs in Barcelona, Madrid, Salamanca and Sevilla.  

-Study Abroad England- Academic Studies offers study abroad programs in London.  

-Study Abroad Italy - Academic Studies offers study abroad programs in Florence.

Fascism  is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism that came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. Influenced by national syndicalism, the first fascist movements emerged in Italy around World War I, combining more typically right-wing positions with elements of left-wing politics, in opposition to communism, socialism, liberal democracy and traditional conservatism.

When done to confuse the public, for personal gain, and it works, it's corrupt, politically, i.e., results in policies that do not accomplish their stated purpose, but rather benefit only a few, inside the alliance."""

 Blocked 

I've extended your block to a week, because I think 24 hours is too lenient here. You've clearly been using at least three accounts to stack votes at ITN (if not elsewhere) and so obciously that it's almost as if you wanted to get blocked. Your actions have shown contempt for consensus and the community in a manner that I've almost never seen before. That you did this at ITN, where things are so much more laid back than in many parts of the project, makes this abuse even more shocking, which is the reason I've extended your block. I will say the following once, and once only: if you ever particiapte in the same discussion on Wikipedia under two identities, logged in or not, in an attempt to stack votes, I will block you indeifnitely and make a motion for a community ban. If I were you, I would be spending the next week reflecting on how I could regain the trust of the community, but if you attempt to evade this block, you will be met with equally stiff sanctions.  | Penny for your thoughts?

 A blog post I think is important 
First, I appreciate the notes that were left recently, and the ones left during the February drama.  I will probably be back, but not like I was before.  I love Wikimedia and everything it is trying to do.  I wanted to be a part of it.  More, I wanted to show its potential.  The worst misconception about me is that I am arrogant about my work.  I most want people to realize that everything I did, they can do too.  You don't even need to do what I did; your own secret hopes and ambitions on here have the potential to succeed.  

It's not self-promotion.  If you are contributing work of such high quality that you could actually make a career for yourself, then Wikipedia is damn lucky to have you.  If what you give is crap, face it:  your stuff will be removed, nobody will stick up for you and you'll have zero hopes of ever branching beyond Wikipedia.  This is important:  you should strive to contribute material that is of such high quality people actually think you could be a professional (but the ridiculous argument that you are using Wikipedia to doing that is stupid beyond belief).  

I outlined on my blog how I went about doing what I did on here, how you could replicate it if you wanted, and general advice.  I don't care if anyone follows it.  But I certainly hope it explains how unexceptional my contributions were; that is, if only other people attempted what I did.  

I'm an artist - I wanted to work on here and give something back.  But I never wish to be a professional photographer or journalist/reporter.  I realize that's a shock for many to believe.  Wikipedia is a great public space to attempt art, whether it be journalism and information as art, or photography that is encyclopedic before it is artistic.  

Here's the blog post where I try to explain how I succeeded to gain access, improved my photography and made a reputation for myself simply for doing what I believed in on Wikipedia:  blog.shankbone.org/2008/07/19/david-shankbone-finally-tells-you-how-to-replicate-his-success.aspx

If contributing high quality work that is recognized on and off Wikipedia is self-promotion, then we need more self-promoters who try to create such high quality.

I take onboard some of the points made here and elsewhere and agree that maybe a full year as an admin isn't strictly necessary - however I still believe that a few more months of experience before asking the community to extend their trust of me is a good idea. Also, the present crats have everything more than under control and there are plenty of other things for me to be doing. I certainly won't let thing go undone however and would consider running whenever backlogs started to mount again. Otherwise, perhaps this is a matter we could revisit towards then end of this year, or start of next... Thanks especially to U.S.A. for a kindly written nomination. scribe

 Sources, offers, and 1975 Iraqi government ads in Toronto Star, New York Times, and Le Monde 

It should be mentioned how different Arab governments have said they would allow former Jewish citizens of their nations to return and live in the Arab world (Morocco, Egypt, Yemen, Iraq, etc). Putting aside if one considers this a credible offer or possible. The clearest example of this (again putting aside what one thinks of it) was again by the Iraqi government on December 11, 1975 putting full page advertisements in numerous Western newspapers (The New York Times, Toronto Star, and Le Monde) asking any Iraqi Jews who left Iraq to feel free to return to Iraq (again putting aside whether one views this as a genuine offer or not). This page is sourced  and is done by someone with a Ph. D.  Also the reality of the existence of in particular the Iraqi government advertisements of December 11, 1975 (calling for any Iraqi Jews to come back to Iraq) is admitted even by ideologically Zionist website [www.eretzyisroel.org/~jkatz/discredit.html] which state that pro-Zionist groups """"scoffed at"""" the Iraqi offer. 

This info should be included and the sources are valid (written by a Ph. D.), especially if writings of the """"JCPA"""" is included as the JCPA is an obviously partisan think-tank associated with the Israeli Likud party in particular (so any noting of the legitimate sources I'm providing, putting aside the pro-Zionist source corroborating in particular the 1975 Iraqi government advertisements, being partisan to one side should also then have the """"JCPA"""" links and writings removed for partisan reasons). This info should be included in the """"compensation"""" section as it by itself (the offer, whether one believes it or things like it are genuine or not) would be an offer of not just """"compensation"""" but a return to where one originally came from in the first place.

Let's see, accusations of parroting, arbitrary classification of users based upon pen-name preferences, straw-men, ignoratio elenchi, and finally begging the question through the same fallacious reasoning as previously. We call that petitio principii, don't we? Apparently nothing will change his mind until I change my pen-name to something like John Doe. How does he know that I am not this Russian dude who likes Iranian history and culture? Oh, that's right, he doesn't. He probably didn't check my IP-address to see that I'm based in Sweden and could in fact be a Swede. Whoops... Sounds like our neutralist is using a subtle profiling method to his convenience.

Like I stated before, it doesn't matter if I'm a Nazi, Communist, Liberal or even a hippie. It doesn't matter if I do drugs, or if I look even remotely like a reptile. It doesn't matter if I'm even an obese Tongan kid. It has no bearing on content or the essentials of an argument, and anything else you might conjure to the favour of some imagined affiliation. This is aptly called speculation.

Now, I will only say two things. First one is a rehearsal of my previous suggestion: Livius.org is visited by thousands of people daily. Along with a number of other scholar-related websites, I can't live without checking it by a daily basis. It deserves a Wiki-article, where Jona Lendering is briefly described as the founder and maintainer of an outlet with roots as far back as -96. Yes, sounds like a plan of revenge. The paragon of Pan-Iranic resurgence! The removal of a Wiki-article of Lendering will remove the last great obstacle to a resurgent Achaemenid empire and the reawakening of the terrifying Persian horsemen of doom! Howl! Howl! Our world is forfeit!

Second point, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: Get laid. Your superior-inferior complex isn't convincing anyone here, whether they be Iranian or not. There is no chance an article of this quality gets to stay. That's the bottom line, irrespective of any perceived reasoning. Either change the article so that it pertains to Livius.org, or stop your incessant whining. Maybe it never occurred to you that by simple observation Jona Lendering has written several Iran-friendly articles and has generally sought to dispel several popular misconceptions on the ancient Iranians. Maybe that's how you make more drama in your life, by arbitrary holier-than-thou attitude.

31019,"Thank you for your kind reply. Judging from the sources I have, I think the concept of spatial tense is only relevant in the context of the artificial language Lojban. The statement that several natural languages have spatial tense as defined in the article is still an unsubstantiated claim, so imho it should be pulled out pending evidence. Part of the problem is the very name of the concept. 'Tense' has the connotation of 'time'. In fact, grammatical tense is frequently (if loosely) defined as 'location in time'. Thus, it doesn't really make sense to talk about 'spatial tense'; it would be like talking about 'temporal place'.
Since the only relevant use of the concept stems from Lojban grammar, I think it would be best to start the article out of the Lojban perspective, defining spatial tense as Lojban grammar defines it. And since spatial tense (according to Lojban grammar) is merely 'obligated expression of location', the broader context of the article should be the expression of space in language. And this is where observations about the connection between language and the way we perceive the world come in. The way I see it, the spatial cases of the Hopi language (one of the many languages that do very interesting things with space) don't really belong in an article about an invented, English-inspired, grammatical category. What we are really missing is a decent article about the way languages deal with location and space. Which is something I added to my to do list. —  (talk) 16:55, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)"

Hello again, Tdadamemd. Getting right to your comment about slang, I don't understand your stating that """"fuck"""" is not slang, or your linking to dictionary.com as proof that it is not. The word """"fuck,"""" while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary.com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse/other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what """"fuck"""" can mean. As for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning """"fuck"""" (or """"fucking"""") and the euphemism """"sleeping together"""" lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse/sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. As you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. 

If WP:CONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal, I'll add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar and/or slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourse/other sexual activity...such as """"fuck"""" and """"sleeping together"""" (the wording won't be exactly like that, of course). And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and """"fuck"""" is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word """"fuck"""" when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why """"fuck"""" isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that """"fuck"""" is also U.S.-centric; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States. 

Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term...they are usually using it as profanity. That is also why I told you """"The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic. However, the term 'fuck' is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse."""" 

I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesn't currently include """"fuck."""" But, like I stated, I don't mind adding it to the article. I'd rather see what others have to state on that matter first, however.   """

This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

 Although Alexa Brown meets the minimum requirements for a separate article, I believe that WP:N's lead is relevant here: """"Editors may use their discretion to merge or group two or more related topics into a single article"""" is highly relevant.  Creating separate pages for these tightly related subjects both causes editorial hassles (trying to keep the two pages in sync and needing to decide whether a piece of information belongs on one page or the other) and reduces the likelihood that a reader will get the whole story (because most people will only read one of them).  Also, keeping it all here may reduce the temptation to use the biography for (self-)promotion of the politically active parents and/or their organization.

Yes it definitely isn't an ideal source, but unfortunately since these events took place in a very secretive, distant battlefield (Mike Spann was the first US casualty in the War in Afghanistan), the fine details of the event are limited to only a few sources, thankfully an experienced and respected English-speaking journalist was there shortly after events to record them.

The question at hand is whether these are true facts that are pertinent to this Wikipedia page and thus deserve to be judged by the people who read it. This is, after all, a page in the Wikipedia and not your personal property. Is that not so? These facts are as follows:

1) Substantial numbers of horses which show many characteristics of purebred Appaloosas have been found in 2014 living in a remote mountain valley of Kyrgyzstan near the Chinese border. These horses exhibit spots, white sclerae, and striped hooves.

2) a DNA analysis conducted by Dr. Gus Cothran at Texas A & M University shows that these Kyrgyzstan horses closely match purebred  American Appaloosas in their genetics.

3) As of 2015, controversy exists as to whether these horses should be considered true Appaloosas. A BBC documentary shows the 69-year-old female New Zealand Appaloosa breeder who rode horseback over a 13,777 foot mountain pass to find these horses. This documentary clearly shows these horses in their native milieu and discusses the DNA evidence.

Now Mr. Montanabw Sir, are those facts not true?  Are they not germane? People come to this Wikipedia Appaloosa page to learn current and pertinent facts about Appaloosas. In that context neither your opinion nor mine count for a plug nickel.

Therefore I will now repeat my question . Exactly why are you continuing to refuse the addition of these facts to this Wikipedia page? If you wish, I don't see why an additional section cannot be added entitled """"Kyrgyzstan horse controversy"""" containing this information. Can you? 

Because if we can't resolve this question here, that is the issue I am going to ask the next level to resolve. I will not ask them to decide about LP genes or whether the BBC has made up some fairy story about the Appaloosa or whether the moon is made of green cheese. I will ask them whether you are in your legitimate rights to deny the inclusion of this information to the Wikipedia readers. Am I speaking clearly enough, Mister?

The same thing happened, when the Arab Muslims invaded the Levant, Mesopotamia and North Africa and intermingled with the local nations, e.g. Berbers, Jews, Arameans, Black people, Copts etc.. After several hundreds of years the Arabs were no longer able to distinguish between pure Arabs and mixed race Arabs. However, their descendants are linguistic and cultural Arabs or do modern Egyptians, Syrians, Tunisians,... don't consider themselves as ethnic Arabs? Are the modern Turks a specific ethnic race? An ethnicity is not only based on genes, if this is that what you mean!

Websters defines hostility as a """"deep-seated usually mutual ill will"""" so an important ingredient is a very strong dislike towards a person or group. Warning people who (in your belief) are taking the wrong moral path does not qualify unless you insult them in the process, especially if you hold yourself to the same standard.

Hi, CSTAR! Of course, you are a great humorist, but something needs to be done in this situation. Those guys (Zarniwoot and FCZenz) are plain stupid. It seems, they still do not understand that this was only a demonstration of force. They do not understand, that, for example, we can spread the attack to much more articles. Fighting with us, Zarniwoot and FCZenz break WP policy all the time and, possibly, cause more damage here than we. Recently, SCZenz blocked an IP-address of an independent person. Crazy guy! (How many other innocent people have he blocked already?) I left him a message about that and a notice that the article Introduction to quantum mechanics was already attacked two times without reversion and was already edited by three (!!!) people.

Your section on how to define area is as vague as most of your other articles. Area is easy to define: It is the product of two averages. Volume is not 'analogous' to area - whoever wrote this, needs to look up the word analogous. Volume is defined as the product of three averages. It is also accurate to say that area has no extent - just like a point or line. Area only begins to take on understandable dimensions once a point or line is assigned extent. As an example: If a line is made up of 3 points of zero extent, it's length is zero. If it is made up of 3 points whose centers are half a unit from the circumference of a circle formed around the same, then the line has length of 3 units.

 Asking users to contact you privately 

Dear editor at 84.75.133.108. You are currently (as you have done in the past) contacting users, in particular administrators, asking them to e-mail you privately about something. I do not know what you wish to talk about but I can assure you that there is probably a better way to accomplish whatever it is that you wish to accomplish. In particular, if you have a legal concern about your personal information on any Wikipedia article, please contact the OTRS team as per Wikipedia:BLPEDIT#Legal_issues. If you are being harassed in some manner, please see Wikipedia:Harassment for advice. If it's a research project, read Wikipedia:Research recruitment. If it's a copyright problem, please follow the directions at Wikipedia:Copyright_violations#Information_for_copyright_owners. I can't really think of too many other problems that are better handled off-wiki and privately. Please be aware of our guidelines against """"canvassing"""", which is wiki-slang for trying to gather support for some particular topic. If people do contact you, please read WP:EMAILPOST to know our stance about the privacy of their emails. Be aware that by posting your e-mail address, you are giving away your private information. """"Deleting"""" it from user's talk pages, as you keep asking of editors, does not not remove that information from public view.

 Inappropriate tone 
The following comment seems inappropriate, given its placement in the article:
""""On the other hand, in Maya rituals prisoners of war were in fact killed 'on top of the pyramid […] by having his arms and legs held while a priest cut open his chest with a sacrificial flint knife and tore out his heart as an offering.'""""

That would be a perfectly fine thing to say if the previous sentence were something like """"The portrayal of human sacrifice in the film has been criticized as inaccurate.""""  But the previous sentence is: """"The film has been accused of fueling a stereotype of native Mesoamericans as bloodthirsty savages with few civilized achievements other than architecture.""""  By offering the human sacrifice description as an """"on the other hand"""" the implication is that civilizations that practiced such human sacrifice were actually """"bloodthirsty savages with few civilized achievements"""".  That's blatantly POV and inappropriate.

I suggest either (A) deleting the offending sentence, (B) moving it to a portion of the article that discusses human sacrifice in particular, or (C) adding a sentence prior to it quoting some specific criticism of the films portrayal of human sacrifice.   

A sentence prior to it would be fine; there should be something out there that contains criticism. — (talk • contrib) - 

 Inaccurate inaccuracies 
Read on the current Inaccuracies section:
""""And the Spanish arriving at the end of the movie came a little too soon, as they actually arrived during the reign of the Aztec Empire, which succeeded the Maya.""""

That sentence had no sense. The Aztecs never conquered or killed off the Mayas. The Mayas where in fact the first Mesoamerican people who encountered the Spaniards on land - around 1510 - and the Spaniards actually knew about the Aztecs from the Mayas.

""""The diseased little girl is often regarded as having smallpox. However, smallpox did not arrive in the Americas until the early 16th century with the Spanish Conquistadores. As the disease is not called by a modern name we cannot be sure what the intention was.""""

As there are Spaniards in the movie, it's sure that the movie doesn't take place before the 16th century. However, you can't guarantee what is the exact year. They are Spaniards, but they have not to be the first Spaniards in the Yucatan, just the first in the lands of the Mayan city-state that is shown in the movie. Spaniards with smallpox can have arrived in other part of the Yucatan and infect the people there, and later these people could extend the sickness to other regions through trade or war. The Southern Ming never visited Europe, but their Black Plague destroyed 1/3 of the European population, and the Incas fell on civil war because an epidemy of smallpox in Mexico extended to South America and killed the emperor and his heir. I suppose that you understand what I'm trying to say. The girl with smallpox it's just another element to support the idea that the end of the Mayan civilization is coming 

Why do you assume that they in the Yucatan?  Others make that jump based on the dialect that the director choose to use.  If language in the movie is the only thing that ties where the story takes place to the Yucatan then I would argue that Gibson only used the dialect because it is still a living language used by many of the extras in the cast.  I cannot see anything else in the film that cements the idea that this was a movie about the Maya in the Yucatan.  RDG"""

I don't understand how I go from that to a deletion of the entire body of work. Can I restore the article and fix whatever issues there were??

Need your detailed feedback.

lord Shiva for Featured article 
I just see many important features relating to the topic was missing, including a small description and link to Maha Shivaratri .       I would like to give my points here.Undoubtedly lord Shiva is linked to all sections and regions of the Indian society.There are great works relating to lord Shiva in many languages. Remember he is pre vedic god, immensely popular among tribes later on included in the Vedas. If the page depicts what is in popular culture it will be a great source and the page should become """"Featured Article"""". I feel there is discrimination of users writing from Tamil / Malayalam / Kannada even Hindi perspective. Sanskrit has its own credits, it is unique and as the name suggests it is """"well written"""". I have written 4 articles on them. But it gets defamed by wrong promoters who make it mess up with other languages / claiming other linguistic works. My article was edited because i mentioned the name of the god in """"Tamil""""?. Those who deleted them know whether Sanskrit and Tamil both used same script once before Sanskrit stuck to Devanagari script )?

[User:Redtigerxyz|Redtigerxyz]]  Talk   TalkInclude Malayalam scripture works on """"Ayyappa"""" please don't completely ignore them. I will give more details for my writings with explanations on sources later for your views. Shiva is linked deeply in Kannada, Maratha and Telugu traditions too, but very less representations in the page. And when it comes to lord shiva and muruga, you just cannot ignore Tamil if you have developed hat redness for the language.  Include details what is popular among different peoples rather than quoting just Vedas.

Per the suggestion above I just got done transferring all the images in this article to the Commons (as well as some other pictures I've taken for other articles of places of interest visible from the road) and put  at the bottom.

I see that NE2 has decided to enforce the no-image-size rule, honored mainly in the breach IME, and while that robs the article of some visual punch I guess we have to do it that way (It leaves more room for the text, to be sure). I did, however, have to pump up the Catskill High Peaks image to de-raggedify the adjacent margin ... there are reasons why people have long ignored that stricture.

Anyway, I was thinking the article could do with two more pictures, particularly from the eastern side of the route which I've neglected for the very simple reason that I don't live there.

Downtown Fishkill. It's a registered historic district. Fortunately, I took a picture with some of the historic buildings in it last weekend that I will be uploading soon.

Lake Carmel. 52 runs along the shore of this very scenic body of water, and from the eastern end some nice pictures are possible. Why should all the beauty in this be on the west side of the river? I usually don't go over this way, but if someone agrees that it would be nice and scenic I would try my best.

Something from Sullivan County. Downtown Liberty is also a historic district, though I can't remember if it looks as nice as Fishkill. Is the Kenoza Stone Arch Bridge visible from 52, or just 52A? I have some Flickr images I've been meaning to put together. Woodbourne Correctional Facility (very visible from the highway, though DOCS officially frowns on pictures) or one of Woodbourne's RHPs (Center Theater or B'nai Jerusalem Synagogue) are also possibilities.

Any thoughts?"

I saw your recent comment on the Yom Kippur war talk page here and I too share your concern and frustration over the endless reverts by the POV pushers such as this one by RomaC. I have had issues with him in the past in connection with other articles. I have yet to see him add relevant content or make one productive edit. I have only observed him engage in endless reverts of sourced material. In any event, we need to build consensus. Currently, You and I as well as   and   favor """"Israeli military victory"""" in the infobox. Sherif, JohnZ and RomaC oppose. The rest seem to be on the sidelines though I believe that   and   seem to be leaning on our side. In fact, Hohum actually reverted Sherif here and restored my sourced edit concerning IDF victory.

Other sources confirm the NE articles on the matter. Olle Engstrand (a professor of phonetics at Stockholm University), """"Fonetikens grunder"""" (""""The basics of phonetics""""), 2004, page 120 (my translation):

All languages have more or less significant regional variations in pronunciation. In Swedish there are differences in the spoken varieties of the standard language (""""Scanian"""", """"Gutnish"""" or """"Dalecarlian"""") as well as variations specific to certain cities [""""stadsmål""""] like """"Stockholmska"""" or """"Göteborska"""". By """"dialect"""" Swedish dialectologists are refering to those local dialects [""""bygdemål"""", """"landsmål""""] that have a straight lineage that can be traced back to Old Norse, a history shared with all other Scandinavian dialects - these form a continuum while the distinct """"national languages"""" like Swedish, Danish and Norweigan are relativly recent constructions.

This is confirmed by Claes-Christian Elert (professor of phonetics at Umeå University 1969-1988) in """"Allmän och svensk fonetik"""" (""""General and Swedish phonetics"""") on pages 34-35. Here are some selected passages (again my translation):

For a long time there has existed speech varieties within the Swedish language area which are used only in certain communities and which have only been slightly influenced by the spoken varieties of central Sweden or by the written language. These are the genuine dialects [the bold font is in the book].

[...]

The variety of language that a visitor to a community encounters most of the time is not the genuine dialect but a reginal speech variety [again Elert's bolding]. Sometimes the standard language is spoken with regional influences. Contrary to the genuine dialects, the regional varieties are almost identical to the central standard language [""""det centrala riksspråket""""] in terms of inflection and syntax. Vocabulary is usually also more or less identical, though some local deviations do exist. It is above all the pronunciation of vowels and consonants as well as prosody of the regional variations that deviate from the standard language. Generally these are similar to the genuine dialects within the same region. The regional standard varieties do not differ as much from one community to another as the genuine dialects.

If you interpret these quotes very generously (that is, not according to what the writers intended), you might be able to support SIL's claims, though not the figures. The claims that Scanian as a regional variety is a seperate language is supported only by Lång and a handful of Scanian regionalists who use completely bogus arguments  and often claim the name should be skåneländska (roughly """"Terra Scanian""""). That it would be a dialect of only Danish is also extremely speculative, and it should at the very least be classified as simply """"East Scandinavian"""". For all practical purposes it is most likely a lot more easily understood by Swedes than Danes.
